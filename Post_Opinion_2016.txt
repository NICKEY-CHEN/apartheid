<title>Advice to Clinton: Don’t try to placate Sanders’s hard-left voters</title>
<date>9/6/2016</date>
<content>
Even following Hillary Clinton’s historic victory in the primaries, there are  some among the most radical Bernie Sanders supporters – let’s call them  Sanderistas – who would actually like to see Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton  in the general election. Their “logic” is as follows: If Clinton wins, Sanders  becomes just another loser. The Sanderistas become marginalized. And their  leader’s quest for a political revolution ends with the election of yet another  centrist “establishment” Democrat.However, if Trump beats Clinton,  Sanders will claim to become the titular leader of the Democratic Party,  pointing to early polls showing that he would have beaten Trump, though these  polls signify little about how he would have done in an actual head-to-head  contest. (In my opinion, he would have suffered a devastating defeat comparable  to those suffered by other left-wing candidates such as Walter Mondale (1984)  and Michael Dukakis (1988), though nothing is predictable with Trump as the  Republican nominee.) Moreover, were Clinton to lose, Sanders’s influence would  increase within the party – and around the country – because the Sanderistas  would take credit for Clinton’s defeat and insist that without them the  Democrats can’t win a general election.




Other Sanderistas have put  forward a more destructive rationale. As one of Sanders’s most prominent  surrogates, the actress Susan Sarandon explained, “[S]ome people feel that  Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in, things will  really explode.”Sarandon, who made the same case for Ralph Nader in the  2000 presidential election (and look how that turned out), is not the only  Sanders supporter who feels that a Trump presidency could be the catalyst for  the leftist political revolution promised by Sanders and his  surrogates.These hard-left radicals, just like their anti-establishment  counterparts on the extreme Right, believe that the nomination system is rigged  if they do not get their way.Ultimately, it’s unsurprising that Trump  has seized on that sentiment and invited them to join forces in the quest for a  revolution: “To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the  cold by a rigged system of superdelegates, we welcome you with open  arms.”As she struggles to unify the Democratic Party, however, Clinton  should be wary: Any effort to embrace the Sanderistas will backfire.They  won’t vote for her anyway, unless she goes so far Left as to fall off the  political cliff. As CNN recently reported, “Sanders has inspired a movement, but  it’s unclear whether he can control it. Or if he wants to... [M]any [of his  supporters] insist they will not fall into line behind Hillary Clinton... They  are taking seriously Sanders’s call for a political revolution, complicating any  hope for quick unity with Clinton.”One such Sanderista is quoted as  saying, “You can’t expose the corruption of the political system and then expect  us to get behind that same political system.” Another threatens that “[i]f  Bernie Sanders does not walk out of that thing as the nominee, we can guarantee  you from that point on we’ll start the de-registration of the Democratic Party.  They have a choice to make.”Even if some Sanderistas were to rally to  Clinton, their votes in swing states would not be enough to have a meaningful  impact on the general election, especially in comparison to the support she  would lose in the political Center, which has little appetite for revolution.  Moreover any appeasement of the far Left will be welcomed by the Republican  Party, which now fears that its centrist wing will defect in large numbers, and  vote for Clinton, because its members regard Trump as something of a kook. If  Clinton embraces the Sanderistas, these voters will view the election as a  contest between the kooky Right and the equally kooky Left. Given that choice,  they will prefer their right-wing kook to the leftwing kook.This is not  to say that Clinton should not consider supporting reasonable programs just  because they were advocated by Sanders.She already has, and should  continue, talked about reducing the gap between the rich and the poor, raising  the minimum wage, rethinking trade agreements, holding Wall Street accountable,  making college more affordable and other domestic economic fixes.She  staked out that territory in her speech on Tuesday night and she should continue  to try to appeal to reasonable Sanders voters, especially among the  young.However, there are two particular areas where the Sanders program  would endanger Clinton’s electoral prospects. The first is domestic: She should  not adopt Sanders economics of spending more than a reasonable budget would  permit. Adopting pie in the sky proposals that would add trillions of dollars to  the budget and dramatically increase the national debt would be a gift to Trump.  Americans don’t want to be debtors who mortgage their children’s future. We want  reasonable spending that we can afford.The second gift to Trump would be  in the area of foreign policy, particularly with regard to the Middle East. Were  Clinton to move away from support for Israel, it could hurt her electoral  chances in several swing states.Americans in general admire and support  Israel.The don’t want a president who would parrot the views of radical  Israel-haters such as Cornel West and James Zogby who falsely accuse Israel of  being an apartheid state that sets up concentration camps and aims to annihilate  Palestinians. Even many of Sanders’s young supporters, some of whom are critical  of certain Israeli policies, especially with regard to the settlements, do not  want the US to adopt the West-Zogby anti-Israel approach.Sanders  received his support from young people for his domestic policy, not his foreign  policy (about which he knows little). He wandered into the morass of Mideast  politics only to satisfy his hard-left supporters who think in absurd packages:  If you support the environment and higher minimum wages, then you must oppose  Israel. That’s not the way centrist and independent voters think, and Clinton  must reject that kind of radical “intersectional” thinking if she is to beat  Trump in the fall.So let Hillary be Hillary and not become  Bernie.
Let her look for guidance to the successful centrist politics of  Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, rather than the failed revolutionary screeds of  Bernie Sanders, Cornel West and Susan Sarandon. We are a centrist nation that  has thrived without the turmoil that extremes – both left and right – bring to  politics and governance. We don’t want to emulate Europe and South America,  which often alternate between socialist and nationalist regimes – between the  Red and the Brown. If she gets too close to the hard-left politics of Sanders’s  most extreme “Bernie or bust” zealots, she may get burned in the general  election – and so will our nation.

<title>Africa and the revitalization of the Zionist dream</title>
<date>24/7/2016</date>
<content>
During his recent four-day whirlwind visit to four East African countries  (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proudly  proclaimed that Israel was “coming back to Africa and that Africa was coming  back to Israel.”After decades of neglect, could Israel’s return to  Africa spark the revitalization of the old Zionist dream of Israel as a light  unto the nations and demonstrate to the world that Israel is far from being the  racist, apartheid state depicted by those trying to delegitimize our country?  During the 1960s and early 1970s, tiny Israel won the hearts and trust of  millions of Africans by sending kibbutzniks, doctors, educators and youth  leaders to work side by side with African farmers, teachers, health officials  and youth organizations to help build their newly independent  countries.




David Ben-Gurion’s and Golda Meir’s genuine sympathy for  Africans and Africa echoed that of Theodor Herzl, the father of modern political  Zionism. Herzl often expressed his desire to assist the redemption of Africa  after he succeeded in redeeming the Jewish people.Africa’s break with  Israel following the 1973 Yom Kippur war left many Israelis feeling betrayed,  while Israel’s alliance with South Africa contributed to the souring of  relations with many African countries.While serving as a catalyst for  the resumption of diplomatic relations with many Africa nations, the 1993 Oslo  accords did not rekindle the warm friendship of the past between Israel and  Africa.By 2000, the large numbers of enthusiastic emissaries of Israel  who had served in Africa on a Zionist mission in the 1960s were by now  pensioners or close to retirement age. Conferences on Israel-Africa relations  revolved more around nostalgic reminiscences of the good old days than visions  and plans for the future.Neither government nor the general public  showed much interest in Africa. Ignorance and negative stereotyping of Africa  prevailed. The African continent was perceived as extremely poor and plagued by  AIDS, corrupt leaders and tribal conflicts. The Israeli government and most of  the public overlooked Africa’s great potential and the advantages of adopting  more Africa-friendly policies. Now, in 2016, a return to Africa offers the  opportunity to update and revitalize Zionism.An enlightened Africa  policy at home and abroad could also undermine the claims that Israel is a  racist and apartheid state put forward by those seeking to delegitimize  Israel.Israel’s return to Africa upholds national political and economic  interests. Like Ben-Gurion, Netanayhu has no qualms seeking African political  support and votes in the UN. At the same time, he is promoting the export of  Israeli products, technology and security expertise in potentially lucrative  markets.Israel’s return to Africa can also support altruistic policies  whereby a) growing numbers of Israeli youth volunteer to serve in Africa; b)  development NGOs like Innovation Africa bring solar energy, drip irrigation and  other low-cost technologies to improve services and raise the incomes of rural  Africans, and humanitarian organizations like ISRAID help Africans deal with  natural disasters; c) stellar research and training institutions like Arava  Institute receive sufficient resources to expand their capacity to train  Africans and make innovative technologies more accessible; and d) Tikkun Olam  projects financed by Jewish philanthropy enable Israeli and Diaspora youth and  development organizations to work together reinforcing the bonds between Israel  and the Diaspora.But there is also much to do at home in dealing with  Africa and Africans.First of all, Israelis could learn more about Africa  and African culture and invite African professors, students, artists,  journalists and government officials to come to Israel.Second, the  government must radically change its policies toward and treatment of the 42,000  African asylum seekers in Israel, mostly Eritreans and Sudanese.It can  implement the recommendations of Prof.Amnon Rubenstein, author of  Israel’s Basic Law on Freedom and Human Dignity who called for a “hard” entry  policy for non-Jewish immigrants and asylum seekers and a “soft,” humane policy  for those already here. The government could declare victory in achieving its  goal of stopping the flood of asylum seekers, thanks to the erection of the  fence along our Sinai border.Third, let the government stop saying that  Israel has no refugees, only illegal infiltrators or economic migrants, without  processing their applications in a fair and timely manner; granting full refugee  status to all those who fit the criteria and granting work permits, freedom of  movement and access to public services to those asylum seekers waiting to have  their applications processed.Fourth, African asylum seekers who have  committed no crimes cannot be sent to Saharonim prison or Holot detention  center. The government could invest most of the tens of millions of dollars now  set aside for running the prison service and deporting asylum seekers to African  countries where they have no legal rights and protection to improve conditions  for Israeli citizens in South Tel Aviv, who have suffered most from the sudden  and massive influx of asylum seekers dumped in their neighborhoods between 2007  and 2012.Finally, if we are to follow Torah ethics, human rights, common  decency and our own self-interest, we would not label African asylum seekers in  Israel as criminals, a demographic threat, or a danger to our national identity  nor regard them as a burden on our society taking resources away from our own  poor. Instead we should see them as respected guests who can contribute to our  society and understanding of Africa.We can do more than offer  protection. We can provide our guests with greater opportunities for education  and training that will help them build their countries when they return. If we  will do these things, they will return as friends and allies of  Israel.Let’s show the world that we can do better than Europe in our  treatment of African refugees, that Israel is far from being a racist nation,  and that the Zionist dream is alive and well, thanks to our rediscovery of  Africa.

<title>A great teaching moment</title>
<date>16/4/2016</date>
<content>
“He is brainwashing you, don’t believe anything he tells you, it’s all  lies.”This was the parting diatribe of a pro-boycott, divestment and  sanctions (BDS) activist, which he screamed at a group of students at  Manhattanville College during my lecture on BDS.




On my spring semester  speaking tour, I was invited to speak by Mellysa, an Emerson Fellow of  StandWithUs at Manhattanville College, and their Hillel director. I was asked to  give them a choice of topics that I usually speak about; Israel, the Middle East  and regional conflicts, for a multicultural group of students on  campus.When it came time to choose a topic, I suggested that they  consider a new lecture I had been asked to give to three northern New Jersey  colleges just two weeks before, where the students wrote the title, “Attacks  from the BDS Crowd: 10 of the Nastiest Things and Falsehoods Thrown at Israel,  and What To Do about Them.” I asked Rachel Klein, the Hillel director of  Westchester County New York, if I could present the same topic, and she  reluctantly agreed. She hesitantly said, “we don’t have a BDS problem on this  campus, so I hope it doesn’t create one.”Well, either I caused a BDS  problem or there was a problem hiding just beneath the surface of this  beautiful, leafy campus.Manhattanville College is a liberal arts  university in Westchester County New York with 1,700 undergraduates and 1,000  graduate students from 76 countries and 48 states. Manhattanville’s mission is  to “educate students to become ethically and socially responsible leaders for  the global community” The group that came to hear me that Thursday night in  April was a multicultural group of students, who on the whole were similar to  other students that come to hear me speak on other campuses, not particularly  knowledgeable on the issues of the Middle East, Israel, or the BDS movement to  delegitimize Israel.Lack of information or interest is the greatest  enemy of those of us who want to create a factual understanding of the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and explain the 1,400-year hatreds within the  Sunni and Shi’ite world.When I speak to any college or highschool group,  I watch the eyes of the audience during my talk to see if I am losing anyone,  and will then immediately re-adjust the talk. But this group remained attentive  right up until the time that a fifty-something member of the audience, sitting  front-row center, interrupted my presentation.A few weeks ago I wrote  about pro-Israel speakers being shouted down by “social justice” activists, as  far-left Progressives, in the name of human rights, claim that they should deny  Israel’s defenders the right to speak.The language of human rights,  i.e.apartheid, ethnic cleansing, racism, is the bludgeon they use to  delegitimize Israel. Part of the reason for this illiberalism is that today,  education and academic discourse at many of universities has degenerated into  narrow- minded political indoctrination by teachers with a one-sided  mission.So it is instructive to describe what I and the students  experienced, what it is like to be heckled.Rachel Klein, the Hillel  director, said, “What students saw at Manhattanville College was all too real –  even when ‘armed’ with the facts, discourse is not possible when the other party  is engaging in harassment and bullying, and clearly not interested in facts. The  real issue on campus is that colleges and universities are becoming places where  harassment, intimidation and bullying silence civil discourse.”So this  became a teaching moment to help undergrads see the intolerance on today’s  college campus firsthand, and begin to understand that this is a terrifying  growing phenomenon.(This was not the first time I have been heckled  speaking on campus.) This gentleman who became my heckler at first began  mouthing to himself that the information in my PowerPoint presentation wasn’t  true.Only I could see him becoming agitated; the students were unaware  of what was about to happen.Next came the hostile questions. He was  particularly angry that I talked about the five times the Arabs of the West Bank  and Gaza could have had an independent state, and how each time either the  greater Arab world, or the Palestinian leadership had rejected or didn’t respond  to the Israeli offers.He said that everything was about the settlements,  that Israel stole the land, and that the 22 percent of the land the Palestinians  were forced to accept was being taken away from them by settlement growth. These  types of statements are usually followed with the claim that Tel Aviv is a  settlement on stolen land.When I asked him why no Palestinian state was  created in the 19 years from 1949-1967 when there were zero settlements, while  Egypt and Jordan occupied those territories, he said it wasn’t true, and then  went on to attack me further. I decided to pursue the argument with him in front  of the students.I asked him, if this were about the settlements and is a  purely territorial conflict, then why in 1967 when Israel captured the West Bank  and Gaza in a defensive war, did the Arab League respond to Israel’s offer of  returning all of the land with the response of “No Peace, No Negotiation, No  recognition” of Israel. He said that was not true. I told him I could not debate  with someone with his or her own set of facts, but he again simply said it  wasn’t true, and I could see him seething with anger.I told him about  the Camp David and Taba peace talks in 2000 and 2001, where Israel offered  control of the Temple Mount to the Arabs, east Jerusalem as the Palestinian  capital, and over 90% of the West Bank for an independent Palestinian state, I  asked why the response to that offer was the suicidal violence of the Second  Intifada.He merely asserted that was a lie.I asked him if he  knew about the Olmert offer in 2008 where Israel offered 100% of the West Bank  with land swaps, the Temple Mount and east Jerusalem as the capital of the new  Palestinian state, which Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had never  bothered to respond to. He said that was a lie. I told him I had even spoken to  the cartographer who had been in the room with Olmert and Abbas to confirm the  offer, but my heckler was not impressed; these things had to be lies, as they  did not conform to his view of reality.What about 2014, I asked him,  when Israel accepted US Secretary of State John Kerry’s offer of negotiations  without preconditions, but the Palestinians rejected the proposal unless all  their preconditions were met beforehand.All lies, of course.His  “facts” neatly fit into a hostile political agenda the goal of which is to  destroy Israel – within any border.That is what BDS is about, not a  twostate solution.After he starting ranting about Israelis never ever  prosecuting anyone who commits a crime against Palestinians, I asked him to wait  until my lecture was over and I would answer some more of his  questions.He became more belligerent and the organizers of the event  asked him to leave, at which time he started confronting the students by  screaming, “you are all being brainwashed, and it’s all lies.”I wish I  were the only speaker who has been verbally attacked in what is suppose to be  the marketplace of ideas on a college campus. In fact America as a whole is  supposed to be a place where free speech flourishes.Just ask Jerusalem  Mayor Nir Barkat, whom pro-BDS advocates recently shouted down in San  Francisco.So what did I tell students to do? If they want to support  Israel I recommended a few options: • First, educate yourselves • Tell personal  narratives, which are more powerful than a list of facts • Build partnerships on  campus with different organizations • Help someone connect to Israel via common  interest • Tell the great story of Israel’s humanitarian record • Don’t give up  or give in to those who have their own set of facts Why tell this story about a  confrontation typical of those we run into as public speakers favoring a strong  Israel? The moral of the story is that we all need to know enough of the  history, enough of the facts, to be ready to push back wherever we can against  the tide of misinformation that otherwise gradually seeps into the general  consensus. Look at Europe, where a large percentage of ordinary people think  Israel is a bully that should be brought to its knees.Could this happen  here? The enemy is working hard at it.The author is the director of  MEPIN™.

<title>All lives matter</title>
<date>7/8/2016</date>
<content>
The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. must be spinning in his grave. A generation  after a coalition of blacks and Jews was the vanguard of the Civil Rights  Movement in America, blacks have formed a new movement for empowerment that not  only excludes Jews, but denies them the right to national liberation. This  disgraceful prejudice was shoved in Israel’s face this past week by a delegation  of the protest movement Black Lives Matter, which came to single out Israel with  false accusations of genocide and to deny Israel’s right to exist.BLM  was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for  shooting unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin. It has grown to some 30 chapters  devoted mainly to ending police brutality in the deaths of other unarmed black  teenagers. Last week BLM released its first platform, titled “A Vision for Black  Lives: Policy Demands for Black Power, Freedom and Justice.” It is a hodgepodge  of calls for reparations for slavery and investment in black education and  economic equality, among other issues, but focuses on the plight of the  Palestinians “living under an imperialistic regime,” in the words of spokeswoman  Shanelle Mathews.




“None of us is free until all of us are free,” BLM  leader Ash-Lee Henderson told The Jerusalem Post, describing the purpose of the  group’s visit to east Jerusalem and the West Bank as aimed at showing solidarity  with “our Palestinian comrades here and in the US.”If this is the state  of black liberation in the US today, it is a direct contradiction to the legacy  of King, as he stated at the annual convention of the Rabbinical Assembly in  1968: “The response of some of the so-called young militants does not represent  the position of the vast majority of Negroes. There are some who are  color-consumed and they see a kind of mystique in blackness or in being colored,  and anything non-colored is condemned. We do not follow that course ... Peace  for Israel means security, and we must stand with all our might to protect her  right to exist, its territorial integrity and the right to use whatever sea  lanes it needs. Israel is one of the great outposts of democracy in the world,  and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land can be transformed  into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy. Peace for Israel means security, and  that security must be a reality.”In case someone missed the point, he is  also attributed with having said, “When people criticize Zionists, they mean  Jews. You’re talking anti-Semitism.”The link between the anti-Zionist  BDS Movement and BLM is evident in the posters seen at both their rallies, “From  Ferguson to Palestine,” expressing a false equivalence between police brutality  in America with the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. This is because, BLM  activists say, the streets of “occupied Palestine” remind them of those of  Ferguson, Missouri, where police fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown  in 2014.Dr. Robert Friedmann, director of the Georgia International Law  Enforcement Exchange told JNS.org: “I can tell you that I’m a second-generation  Holocaust survivor. Forty members of my family were murdered in the  Holocaust. I don’t want somebody who has a sense of being abused telling  me what being abused is all about.”In a statement Wednesday, T’ruah: The  Rabbinic Call for Human Rights endorsed the BLM platform’s demands concerning  economic justice, mass incarceration and law enforcement, but criticized its  section on Israel. “Israel’s government is not carrying out a plan intended to  wipe out the Palestinians,” it said, pointing out that “One can vigorously  oppose occupation without resorting to terms such as ‘genocide,’ and without  ignoring the human rights violations of terrorist groups such as  Hamas.”Rabbi Ari Hart, the founder of Uri L’Tzedek, an Orthodox  organization for social justice, commented on The Forward.com: “I was dismayed  and disheartened to see the most prominent voice for racial justice in the US  adopt a hateful, un-nuanced, biased and totally unrelated position on Israel,  calling Israel a perpetrator of ‘genocide’ and an ‘apartheid state.’ It is  neither.
“Do the organizers of the Movement for Black Lives know that  today, in Mauritania, Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan, there are an estimated more  than 1 million black bodies actually enslaved — as in chains, whips and forced  labor?” Falsely accusing Israel of being a genocidal apartheid state perpetuates  anti-Semitic incitement and ultimately endangers Israeli lives – which also  matter.

<title>An Israeli-Palestinian lawmaker does not value the lives of his own people</title>
<date>7/3/2016</date>
<content>
The March 6 edition of The Jerusalem Post had a fascinating  article that included a quote from the most senior member of the Joint List  faction in the Knesset, Ayman Odeh. On a Saudi-owned satellite television  station a few days earlier, he had said, “It’s not my place to tell the  Palestinian people how they should resist” and that “a popular intifada is most  beneficial for the Palestinians.”This statement comes at a time when  tens of Palestinians are losing their lives after committing acts of terrorism  against Israelis throughout the land of Israel. It was said at a time when an  increasing number of Palestinian teenagers and young adults seem to be motivated  to commit violent acts. At the same time, the Palestinian leadership, both  within the State of Israel and in Judea and Samaria, refuses to condemn the  lethal acts being perpetrated by these Palestinians, which often result in the  loss of their lives and the suffering of their families and loved  ones.




It is difficult to understand the absence of any real leadership on  the part of the Israeli Palestinians and the elected members of the Palestinian  Authority. It is a sad state of affairs when these leaders refuse to value the  lives of their own constituents.Their claim is that their acts of  violence are a result of the political situation that exists between Israel and  the PA and the frustration over the failure to establish a Palestinian state  alongside Israel.When do we as human beings believe that the frustration  we may feel over a political situation demands the loss of the lives of others?  Even though the present situation is so often compared to Nazi Germany or to  South Africa’s apartheid policy, it is nowhere near either of those situations.  Victims of Nazi Germany and black citizens of South Africa will attest to the  differences between the present political conflict between Israel and the  Palestinians and the situations they lived through in their  countries.There are no laws that restrict the Israeli Arab citizens of  Israel from participating fully in Israeli society; Israel has not created  multiple levels of citizenships for Jews, Muslims, Christians and Druse. All are  subject to the same laws and receive the same benefits as citizens of the  democratic State of Israel.The right to express one’s disagreement with  government policy and to stage a protest is guaranteed in Israel and is  encouraged, as long as it is done in a peaceful manner.This does not  include throwing rocks at cars, shooting at passersby, stabbing pedestrians with  knives or using motorized vehicles to run over people.Citizens of the PA  are subject both to its laws and the laws of the State of Israel as applied to  the disputed territories of Judea and Samaria. Instead of sanctifying the lives  or their own people as well as the lives of Israeli citizens, the leaders of the  Palestinians living in both Israel and the PA territory remain silent, claiming  they cannot tell their constituents and fellow Palestinians how to protest the  policies and practices of the State of Israel. They act as if they would rather  attend funerals and make condolence calls than ensure that their people live  productive lives and learn how to appropriately express their social and  political disagreements with the ruling authority until a secure and lasting  peace between our peoples is achieved.The present situation is truly  quite sad. Leaders such MK Ayman Odeh are leading their own people to their  deaths by not speaking out and modeling the way people should behave in a  democracy.How do they expect the Palestinians to create a viable  democratic state and society if they do not learn how to express their opinions,  support and disagreements with the ruling bodies in an appropriate manner? It  will truly be sad, if and when there is a Palestinian state, if these violent  expressions become the accepted approach in the new state.
Let us hope  that MK Odeh and his colleagues in the Knesset and in the PA will reconsider  their approach, exemplify true leadership and appeal to their own people to  protest and demonstrate appropriately and not resort to dying on the streets of  the land they so desire to govern.

<title>Roger Waters is the ‘odd man out’</title>
<date>19/10/2016</date>
<content>
Roger Waters’s support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement  shows just how much of an anomaly he is at this week’s Desert Trip festival –  not to mention in the wider artistic community.Waters expends a great  deal of energy attempting to convince artists to embrace the cultural boycott of  Israel and refrain from performing there. He is one of the most vocal supporters  of the movement, and by far the most celebrated musician to have embraced it.  Four out of the other five acts at Desert Trip, however – The Rolling Stones,  Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Neil Young – have been victimized by and  explicitly rejected BDS pressure, including personal appeals from Waters  himself.




Any artist who schedules a performance in Israel is subjected to  a constant flow of false and inflammatory pressure by supporters of the cultural  boycott, who attempt to manipulate them into canceling their show.They  accuse Israel of apartheid and genocide – accusations which can be proven false  with even a modicum of research – using and abusing the struggles of others, and  the emotional responses they trigger, in their battle against the Jewish  state.Though it often presents itself as a movement working to achieve  Palestinian rights, to the founders and leaders of the BDS movement it is merely  a tool to end the existence of the State of Israel. This violent aim is  sometimes reflected in the tactics of boycott supporters.Paul McCartney  last performed in Israel in 2008. Though he received intense pressure to cancel  his show – including death threats – he went ahead and performed. He is not  alone in receiving violent threats from BDS supporters.English rocker  Eric Burdon and Malian musician Salif Keita reported the same. Though Burdon  performed despite the threats, Keita’s management decided to cancel the show in  order “to protect the artist from being harmed personally and professionally” by  “a group named BDS, who also threatened to keep increasing an anti-Salif Keita  campaign... and to work diligently at ruining the reputation and career that Mr.  Keita has worked 40 years to achieve not only professionally, but for human  rights and albinism,” according to a statement he released.In 2014, the  Rolling Stones performed for more than 50,000 Israelis – after they stood up to  boycott pressure, including a personal appeal from Roger Waters. What is less  known is that the seed that led the Stones to perform in Israel was planted by  Bob Dylan shortly before his own show in Tel Aviv in 2011.“Bob Dylan was  coming off stage,” Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood said, “and I asked him –  ‘where you going?’ And he said, ‘Israel – we’re going to Tel Aviv!’ He had a big  smile on his face, because he loves it. And I said to him, ‘Well, we’ve never  done it.’ That planted a seed that I’d like to play it one day. So, here we  go....”Recent Nobel Prize winner Dylan even wrote a song in 1983 about  Israel and its struggle to survive in a tough neighborhood, criticizing the fact  that some characterize the country as the neighborhood bully. “The neighborhood  bully just lives to survive / He’s criticized and condemned for being alive /  He’s not supposed to fight back, he’s supposed to have thick skin / He’s  supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in / He’s the neighborhood  bully.”Neil Young was scheduled to perform only a month after the  Stones, in July 2014. For months he was subjected to an intense barrage of  pressure from BDS supporters – perhaps more intense than the other three  combined – which also including direct outreach from Waters. To get to Young,  BDS activists manipulated the cause of the First Nations in Canada (a cause  close to Neil’s heart), falsely comparing their history to that of the  Palestinians and completely ignoring any Jewish connection to the land. The use  of emotional triggers to the detriment of fact is a common BDS tactic.In  the end, the choice was not his. Shortly before his scheduled performance, it  was canceled by the Israeli security services “in order not to put people in  Gaza rocket range at unnecessary risk,” as thousands and thousands of rockets  were fired toward Israeli population centers by Hamas.“It is with heavy  hearts and deep sadness that we must cancel our one and only Israeli concert due  to tensions which have rendered the event unsafe at this time,” a spokesman for  Neil Young said. “We’ll miss the opportunity to play for our fans, and look  forward to playing in Israel and Palestine in peace.”We at Creative  Community for Peace (CCFP), an organization comprised of prominent members of  the entertainment industry devoted to promoting the arts as a means to peace and  to countering the cultural boycott of Israel, applaud The Rolling Stones, Bob  Dylan, Paul McCartney and Neil Young for their willingness to stand up to  boycott pressure and perform for their fans in Israel.Hundreds of  artists do the same every year, creating spaces for Arabs and Jews, religious  and secular, Left and Right to come together, sing together, dance together, and  perhaps just lay down one more brick on the path to peace.Roger Waters,  on the other hand, continues to lend his voice to a movement dedicated to  keeping Jews and Arabs apart, and ultimately to dismantling the State of Israel.  He compares Israel to Nazis and Nazi collaborators, an ugly and libelous attack;  describes the country as a “systematic racist apartheid regime”; and talks about  classic antisemitic tropes such as the “Jewish Lobby.”We hope that  Waters will be positively influenced by his colleagues, cease spreading untruths  and misinformation that only fan the flames of conflict, and rather use his  considerable voice to unite.

<title>A rational debate on BDS</title>
<date>25/2/2016</date>
<content>
BDS was back on the agenda this week, as Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan  held a “top-secret” conference to discuss ways to combat the anti-Israel  movement.Journalists were not invited, but the secret wasn’t very well  kept and details of the conference were leaked to the press with soundbites,  slogans and all.




For example, “Boycotts divide people and that’s part of  the problem, not the solution” and “The BDS movement is not about legitimate  criticism.It’s about making Israel illegitimate.”A few months  ago, a special unit was reported to have been set up inside the Research  Division of Military Intelligence to monitor the activities of the BDS movement.  Former Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit has called for the spy agency to be involved  in the fight.And Sima Vaknin Gil, a former military chief censor, who  was recently appointed director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry, has  said she wants to set up a “community of fighters.” The ministry, which is in  charge of combating BDS, has an NIS 100 million budget to go “on the offensive  against the boycott.”Cloak and dagger operations, however, were not what  was on the agenda in front of 150 Jewish leaders from around the world. What was  discussed were issues such as detection of boycott threats, concrete steps to  deal with threats to companies in or working with Israel, increasing pro-Israel  activities online around the world, positive branding for Israel, bringing  groups of influential people to visit Israel.Discussion also focused on  the need for a comprehensive strategy that coordinates all the efforts of  governmental, nongovernmental and Diaspora Jewish groups combating BDS and the  delegitimization of Israel.All of these are, of course, critically  important and the threat posed by BDS and efforts to delegitimize Israel should  not be taken lightly. BDS is clearly anti-Semitic and without a doubt waging a  war of legitimacy on the Jewish state. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is  right that BDS “is not connected to our actions; it is connected to our very  existence.”But a little perspective is in order.While BDS has  had some success in academic circles, against some consumer products, and some,  mostly has-been, performers have canceled gigs in Israel, it’s economic impact  has been so minuscule as to barely be measurable.Since the BDS movement  was set up in 2005, Israeli exports to Europe, where the movement is at its  strongest, have nearly doubled. Even trade with South Africa, a BDS stronghold,  where Israel is burdened in the theater of public opinion by its ties with the  apartheid era regime, is booming.Foreign investment in Israel has soared  during that period and at the same time ties with China, India and the rest of  Asia, where BDS is not an issue, are growing exponentially.Israel has  also had successes in countering the movement. Since the beginning of the year  the UK has announced it is advancing anti-BDS legislation, French Prime Minister  Manuel Valls has said “authorities must change their attitude” toward  demonstrations that call for a boycott of Israeli products. The Canadian  parliament has passed a motion condemning BDS and in the United States the  “Combating BDS Act” is in the works to support the rights of states to cut ties  with entities that “boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel.”Yet  despite all this, BDS is being described in existential terms. Netanyahu has  declared war on the movement and compared BDS to Nazi attacks on Jews and  President Reuven Rivlin has pronounced it a “strategic threat of the highest  degree.”If the movement were to succeed in labeling Israel as an  apartheid state, that would be a grave development, and the wind on US campuses  is not blowing in Israel’s favor. But despite the hype there has been no major  reversal and BDS has scored no significant victory that would change the playing  field.It seems BDS has become a political football used by various  parties for their own means without any regard to changes in objective reality.  The left has hyped statements that Israel could be vulnerable to international  boycotts in the absence of a peace process, in order to push its  agenda.At the other end of the spectrum, some observers have noted that  Netanyahu, following the conclusion of the Iran nuclear deal, is in need of a  new existential fear and that by registering victories – against a threat that  was never that great in the first place – he can show himself to be a  strongman.Opposition leader Isaac Herzog has accused Netanyahu of  failing to stem the tide and from the center, too, Yair Lapid, has been using  BDS to prove his diplomatic credentials, as witnessed by his spat with Netanyahu  this week over who got the London underground to take down anti-Israel posters  that were there illegally in the first place.
But if Israel wants to  combat BDS, then a rational and open debate on the real dangers posed by the  movement is the order of the day, not secret meetings and calamitous forecasts.

<title>Are Jews who refuse to renounce Israel excluded from ‘progressive’ groups?</title>
<date>25/8/2016</date>
<content>
Hard-left activists are trying to exclude Jews who do not renounce Israel from  “progressive” organizations.Last year, Rabbi Susan Talve, a longtime  activist on race issues in the St. Louis area, was told that her advocacy for  Israel was incompatible with the objectives of Black Lives Matter: “Solidarity  from Ferguson to Palestine has become a central tenet of the movement” she was  informed, because “Israeli and US state oppression are deeply interconnected.”  Similarly, a student who attended a Black Lives Matter rally at Northwestern  University last year was told “you support Israel, so you cannot also support  us.”




That seems to be the current response of many of the hard-left  activists who dominate so-called “progressive” social justice  movements.Over the past several years, progressive Jews, and progressive  supporters of Israel, have had to come to terms with the reality that those who  do not reject Israel and accept Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions and its unique  brand of bigotry are no longer welcome in some progressive circles. And while  both Democratic and Republican parties have embraced the importance of the US  alliance with Israel, that dynamic is under threat more so than at any point in  my lifetime.The self-described “progressive wing” of the Democratic  Party – represented by radical and often repressive organizations such as  MoveOn, CodePink, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter – has become openly  opposed to the nation-state of the Jewish people. Increasingly, these  organizations demand that their members and “allies” renounce support for Israel  and for Zionism in order to belong. Using the pretext of intersectionality – a  pseudo- academic theory which insists that all social justice movements, except  those supportive of Jews or Israel, are inexorably linked – anti-Israel  activists have successfully made opposition to Israel and support for BDS a  litmus test, especially for Jews, to belong to “progressive” movements focused  on a wide range of issues.Earlier this year, supporters of the LGBTQ  community in Israel learned this lesson the hard way, when BDS activists  together with a local Black Lives Matter chapter broke up a gay pride event,  because it featured a presentation by an Israeli group. The protesters claimed  that the event organizers had engaged in “pinkwashing” the Israeli occupation by  showing solidarity with the Israeli LGBTQ community.Members of the  National Women’s Studies Association (NWSA) who also support Israel have been  similarly excluded. That organization voted last year to endorse BDS, and as one  pro-BDS activist explained: “What is significant about this particular  resolution is the rationale: the fact that the resolution makes it explicit that  BDS is a feminist issues… that one cannot call themselves a feminist... without  taking a stand on what is happening in Palestine.” (Apparently, one can call  oneself a feminist without taking a stand on Syria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and  other nations that grossly violate human rights.) This type of repressive  ideological packaging has left progressive Jews, and liberal supporters of  Israel, in an increasingly uncomfortable position. On the one hand, they care  deeply about causes such as women’s rights, criminal justice reform, income  inequality, environmental protection and LGBT rights. On the other, they find  themselves excluded from the groups that advance those very causes, because –  while they are often critical of specific Israeli policies regarding settlements  and the occupation – they refuse to renounce Israel as a national liberation  movement of the Jewish people.For hard-left activists, this sort of  nuanced position is impossible to accept. Their hostility toward Israel does not  stem from any particular Israeli action or policy – even if Israel were to  withdraw from the West Bank, destroy the security barrier, and recognize Hamas  as a legitimate political organization, it would still not be enough. For these  radicals, it is not what Israel does, it is about what Israel is: the  nation-state of the Jewish people, or, to use hard-left terminology: an  imperialistic, apartheid, and genocidal colonialist enterprise. The recently  released Black Lives Matter policy platform offers a perfect example of such  extreme rhetoric: it states that US military and economic support for Israel  makes American citizens complicit in “the genocide taking place against the  Palestinian people.”The fact that the BLM platform reads like it was  lifted from a BDS screed is hardly coincidence: the two groups enjoy a  longstanding relationship, and a prominent BDS activist apparently helped draft  elements of the BLM declaration. But BLM is far from the only hard-left  organization that has been infected by BDS vitriol. In fact, BDS has pressured a  wide range of progressive organizations into assuming an anti-Israel posture.  The American Green Party, for example – which has become a haven for disaffected  progressive activists this election cycle – recently came out in support of BDS,  and called for the US to end its support for “the Israeli apartheid  regime.”This trend has been particularly pronounced on college campuses,  where a host of academic groups – most absurdly the Native American Scholars  Association and the Americans Studies Association – have passed resolutions in  favor of BDS. Many of these organizations have also endorsed the Palestinian  Academic and Cultural Boycott (PACBI), which encourages participants to engage  in McCarthyite blacklisting of Israeli academic institutions, as well as groups  and individuals who promote “Brand Israel.” This category apparently includes  artists like Matisyahu, and academics like me, as I found out last year when a  prominent BDS advocate refused to debate me at the Oxford Student  Union.The PACBI also explicitly denounces “normalization projects” –  programs or events aimed at Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation that do not  sufficiently emphasize the colonialist nature of the state of Israel. These are  exactly the types of initiatives widely supported and promoted by progressives  who are critical of settlements, but remain supportive of Israel and of a  two-state solution. It is no coincidence that BDS has singled them out for  special treatment. BDS campaigners want to force any supporters of Israel – no  matter their stances on other political issues – outside of the progressive  tent.This effort has proved alarmingly successful thus far, but despite  the pressure from the hard-left, liberals and progressives who support Israel  must continue to carve out a political space for themselves. In doing so, they  can follow the example of the Jewish Community Relations Council, which  dissociated itself “from the Black Lives Matter platform and those BLM  organizations that embrace[d] it,” but committed itself “unequivocally to the  pursuit of justice for all Americans, and to working together with our friends  and neighbors in the African-American community, whose experience of the  criminal justice system is, far too often, determined by race.” Such efforts are  critical to ensure that it is not supporters of Israel but rather those  repressive bigots who falsely claim the mantle of progressivism, and who  subscribe to the identity politics practiced by BDS, that are delegitimized by  mainstream progressives and liberals.

<title>A Shavuot odyssey</title>
<date>10/6/2016</date>
<content>
As one who was born and raised on the  southern end of the Dark Continent, the festival of Shavuot had entirely  different connotations for me and my fellow South African Jews compared with  those who grew up in Israel, Europe or the United States.My hometown is  Johannesburg, where the festival is usually celebrated in deepest winter.  Although Johannesburg winters are not as severe as those in the Northern  Hemisphere, the nights can be extremely chilly with temperatures going down to  freezing point. The atmosphere there was more like Hanukka than Shavuot. Many  people would have celebrated the holiday with hot drinks and cheesecake in front  of a cozy fire.




My first memories of Shavuot are as a very young child in  the local Jewish kindergarten. I remember how all the children in the  kindergarten were made to participate in a “firstfruits” ceremony in the nearby  synagogue.Each sweater-clad child carried a container of fruit down the  central aisle of the shul. As it was winter, there were no firstfruits. Still,  we managed to cobble together a shoebox decorated with blue and white crepe  paper filled with local winter produce, including apples, oranges and the odd  guava.Fast-forward to my teenage years, when I progressed from an ardent  secular Zionist to a religious one. I joined Bnei Akiva and experienced my first  Tikun Leil Shavuot in the Bnei Akiva Synagogue in Grafton Street,  Yeoville.The concept of tikun leil is a fairly recent development.  Following the Shavuot evening meal, worshipers proceed to the synagogue for the  evening service, followed by an all-night Torah study session based on the  kabbalistic practice that was initiated in Safed in the 16th century.In  the 1960s and ’70s, Yeoville was the center of Orthodox Jewish life in  Johannesburg. Today it is a no-go crime-ridden area. The Bnei Akiva Synagogue  became a magnet for scores of youngsters. The holiday began early and I have  vivid memories of the boys and girls gathered round a kerosene brazier wrapped  in coats and blankets, while the Shabbat urns steamed away in the background. We  kept ourselves warm and awake with coffee and cookies, listening to lecture  after lecture until the dawn, when the sun rose at around 7 a.m.I  emerged from the darkness of apartheid-ridden South Africa into the freedom and  light of London, where I resided for many years. There, the experience of  Shavuot could not have been more different.Because Shavuot falls around  the time of the summer solstice, the evening service begins only at around 10  p.m.followed by a rushed festive meal and a midnight Tikun. This often  ended at around 3 a.m. when the first rays of the sun appeared on the horizon,  allowing us to be home and in bed by 6 a.m.One Shavuot in the Northern  Hemisphere that stands out in my memory was spent with my wife’s family in the  Five Towns in Woodmere, New York.The opulent indulgence is forever  etched in my culinary memory. The good folks of Woodmere were dressed to the  nines! Professional caterers were hired to feed the hungry learners between  lectures. The menu would have done any Italian restaurant proud.The  all-night fare included every kind of pasta from penne to ziti. The pièce de  résistance was a French chef complete with chef’s hat preparing crêpes suzette  and omelettes for those who were not embarrassed to indulge themselves  further.The ultimate celebration of Shavuot has to be in the Land of  Israel and especially in Jerusalem. Soon after 10:30 p.m., when folks have  finished reciting Grace after Meals, the streets begin to fill with people  wending their way to attend Torah lectures in every part of the city. Religious,  secular, men, women, young and old gather in synagogues and lecture rooms to  listen to words of Torah delivered by the great and the good in Hebrew, English,  French, Russian, Yiddish and Spanish. The tradition of Tikun Leil Shavuot has  spread across the land and was brilliantly captured in Joseph Cedar’s  award-winning movie Footnote. Newspapers publish special pullout sections  detailing which lecture is being given where, by whom and at what  time.The culmination of Shavuot’s night of learning in Jerusalem is the  procession of worshipers to the Western Wall.This takes place at around  4 a.m. when the city reverberates to the sound of thousands of marching feet  that stream toward the Old City, where upwards of 50,000 people gather to pray.  It is a truly unforgettable sight.Recently I read about the 19th-century  rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, who commented that the Festival of Shavuot is the  culmination of the journey of the Jewish people, who were given their physical  freedom on Passover, and received their spiritual redemption seven weeks later,  after the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai.This represents a journey  from darkness to light, one with which many of us, including myself, can  identify in our own unique way.

<title>As I see it: ‘Autumn for Jew-bashing’ is beyond satire</title>
<date>15/9/2016</date>
<content>
Remember Springtime for Hitler, the  musical from hell in the immortal Mel Brooks movie The Producers? Well, British  political activists are now promising us “Autumn for Jew-bashing.”In  response to the Labour Party’s crisis over its anti-Jewish attitudes, a group  called the Jewish Labour Movement is reportedly organizing a “rally against  antisemitism” at the party’s annual conference next month. However, while  Springtime for Hitler was comedy, Labour’s proposed spectacle is beyond  satire.




For the chorus line includes the Labour MP Naz Shah, the shadow  Chancellor John McDonnell and the author of the party’s report on antisemitism  Shami (now Baroness) Chakrabarti.Shah shared a graphic on her Twitter  account which suggested all Israelis should be relocated to America. She  has since grovellingly apologized and asked the Jewish community to educate  her.McDonnell, who says party members with antisemitic views should be  banned for life, shared a platform this week with Jackie Walker who claimed Jews  were the “chief financiers of the sugar and slave trade.” He also once  tabled a motion in Parliament claiming that “Israel tries to suppress criticism  with false accusations of antisemitism.”As for Chakrabarti, dismay that  her whitewash report signally failed to acknowledge the breadth and depth of  Labour’s anti-Jewish attitudes turned into outrage and contempt when Corbyn  rewarded her for her anodyne platitudes with a peerage and a likely shadow  cabinet role.All that’s needed now is for Ken Livingstone to perform the  goose-step with his finger resting on his top lip while repeating yet again his  line that Hitler was a Zionist supporter and Labour’s “rally against  antisemitism” will have brought the house down.The Jewish Labour  Movement is trying to save the party from being tarred with the brush of  Jew-baiting. This can’t be tolerated because, as everyone knows, Labour  is anti-racist or it is nothing. So these attitudes have to be spun as some kind  of aberration.Alas, they are not. Labour’s hard-left leader Jeremy  Corbyn, who calls Hezbollah and Hamas his “friends” and can’t bring himself to  pronounce Israel’s name, is blamed for legitimizing extremist attitudes toward  Israel which have released the virus of antisemitism.Nevertheless, these  attitudes have long been typical not just of the Corbynistas but of progressive  opinion both inside and outside the Labour Party. Anti-Zionism and hatred of  Israel are the default position on the Left.As the extremism researcher  Dave Rich says in his new book, The Left’s Jewish Problem: Jeremy Corbyn, Israel  and Anti-Semitism, for progressive people Israel has become “the epitome of  Western domination, racism and colonialism, and the Palestinians have come to  represent all victims of Western power and militarism.”Jew-hatred  through the ages has unique characteristics: deranged lies and blood libels,  double standards, obsessional malice, the imputation of a cosmic conspiracy of  evil. Israel-hatred has exactly the same unique characteristics. Legitimate  criticism it most certainly is not.Yet those on the soft Left deny any  link between their Israel-bashing and antisemitism, which they blame entirely on  Corbyn, the hard Left and the extreme Right.Rich’s book contains much  that blows these self-serving progressive disavowals out of the water. He  rightly identifies the New Left as the driving force behind liberal  antisemitism, painting everything associated with the West as bad and everything  to do with the developing world as good or justified.He also points out  that it was not some Trotskyite grouping that turned the Left into an  anti-Israel lynch mob but Britain’s Young Liberals who first libeled Israel with  the utterly false claim of “apartheid.” Moreover this charge, which originated  from the PLO in 1964 and thus predated the Six Day War, was used by the Young  Liberals to condemn as illegitimate not the settlers but the existence of Israel  itself.Not everyone who bashes Israel in this way is an antisemite. It  is possible to be against antisemitism but nevertheless subscribe out of sheer  ignorance to a picture of Israel based entirely on lies.There is,  nevertheless, a distinction between the teller and the tale. Those who demonize  Israel, both Jew and non-Jew, are expressing an irrational hostility to the  Jewish people or the concept of Jewish peoplehood, all of which is a form of  anti-Jewish discourse.No one ever calls mainstream progressive opinion  to account for these vicious attitudes. No one ever calls out left-wing  “anti-racists” for supporting a Palestinian agenda which rests on Jew-hating  libels and caricatures straight out of the Nazi playbook.What was the  response when the former Labour foreign secretary, Jack Straw, reportedly told a  meeting in 2013 that “unlimited” funds available to US Jewish organizations were  the greatest obstacle to peace between Israel and the Arabs? Silence.To  eradicate antisemitism from the Labour Party would force left-wingers to do  something they find simply impossible: face up honestly to the truth about  themselves.They ignore the antisemitism in left-wing thinking because to  admit it would knock the political ground from under their feet. This is because  they believe that leftism is virtue incarnate and antisemitism only ever occurs  on the Right. It is impossible for them to admit they support an anti-Jewish  agenda, even in ignorance, because if the doctrine of their own moral perfection  is smashed the whole progressive agenda goes smash too.It’s safest,  therefore, to pin antisemitism on the extremes: the far Right and the hard Left.  When Labour’s “moderates” attack Corbyn, however, they are in fact holding up a  mirror to themselves.

<title>As I see it: Bewildered Britain still doesn’t get it</title>
<date>31/3/2016</date>
<content>
What is that unfamiliar rustling in the British cultural undergrowth? It’s the  sound of people suddenly acknowledging a problem with anti-Semitism.For  years, anti-Semitism in Britain was the prejudice that dared not speak its name.  The hostility toward Israel endemic in educated circles was emphatically  declared to have nothing whatever to do with hatred of Jews. Anyone who claimed  a connection was denounced as “waving the shroud of the Holocaust” to silence  legitimate “criticism” of Israel.




Jewish students have long run the  gauntlet of vicious Israel- and Jew-hatred. “Israel apartheid” weeks, BDS  motions and campus conferences declaring Israel is a “settler-colonial state”  have morphed into intimidation, stigmatization and discrimination against Jews  at university.VIRTUALLY NO ONE outside the Jewish community has paid  this any attention.Now, though, unease has begun to seep into British  national consciousness.The reason is a shift in perspective. Israel is  no longer seen as the world’s major flashpoint. The TV news is instead pumping  images of Syrian atrocities and floods of displaced migrants into the living  rooms of the nation.Security officials repeatedly warn of the likelihood  of coordinated Islamist attacks in Britain. The terrorist atrocities last year  in Paris and most recently in Brussels have ratcheted up anxiety  levels.After the Paris attacks, though, something else changed. Many,  from Prime Minister David Cameron downward, expressed their shock when British  Jews said they no longer felt safe in Britain, specifically as Jews. How could  this be, Britain asked itself in blinkered bewilderment.With the  election of the far-left Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labor Party, moreover,  two further things happened to propel the issue of Jew-hatred to  center-stage.First, people became aware that this potential future prime  minister had been “honored” to host members of Hamas and Hezbollah, and  supported people who had promoted blood libels or 9/11 conspiracy theories  against the Jews. At the same time, however, Jew-bashers became bolder as the  far-left started to dominate the Labor Party. As a result, the party has become  engulfed by more and more revelations of anti-Semitism, which Corbyn has been  unable or unwilling to put to rest.Vicki Kirby, a former Labor  parliamentary candidate, was suspended for tweeting that Jews had “big noses,”  Adolf Hitler was the “Zionist god” and Islamic State should attack Israel. She  had her suspension lifted and became vice chairwoman of a local party branch  before exposure of these events forced Labor to suspend her  again.Another Labor member, Gerry Downing, who has extolled “Hamas  heroism” and demanded that the “Jewish question” be solved, was expelled from  the party but then readmitted. He was expelled again only after Cameron raised  the case in Parliament.Meanwhile, the issue of campus Jew-hatred  exploded when Alex Chalmers, the non-Jewish co-chairman of the Labor  Party-affiliated Oxford University Labor Club (OULC), resigned with a  devastating account of the Jew-bashing in such circles.“Whether it be,”  he wrote, “members of the executive throwing around the term ‘Zio’ (a term for  Jews usually confined to websites run by the Ku Klux Klan) with casual abandon,  senior members of the club expressing their ‘solidarity’ with Hamas and  explicitly defending their tactics of indiscriminately murdering civilians, or a  former co-chair claiming that ‘most accusations of anti-Semitism are just the  Zionists crying wolf,’ a large proportion of both OULC and the student Left in  Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews,” he wrote.The  Chalmers statement received huge attention from the British media. For the first  time, non-Jewish commentators started expressing horrified concern about the  swell of anti-Semitism.Many, though, still don’t get it. Where did all  this come from, they ask – unable to comprehend that, for the answer, they need  to look within themselves.The former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan  Williams, now master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, has said he is shocked by  a series of anti-Semitic incidents at British universities and criticized the  “muted” official response.However at Christmas 2006, while Williams was  in charge of the Church of England, he preached that Christians were being  driven out of Bethlehem by Israel’s policies and its security barrier. Yet it is  Bethlehem’s Muslim administration that the town’s Christians have fled, while  Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Christians are  safe.In a similar vein, Chris Bryant, Labor’s shadow leader of the House  of Commons, has warned against “anti-Semitism by proxy” in his party, and  observed: “Questioning the very existence of the State of Israel is a  not-too-subtle form of anti-Semitism.”Yet he also wrote: “The Israeli  settlements are illegal and must stop. All too often, the Israeli government has  made it impossible for the Palestinians to build homes, develop infrastructure  or even have access to basic utilities.”Like Williams’ comments about  Bethlehem, these charges by Bryant are false, grossly unfair and part of the  demonization of Israel that leads directly to Jew-bashing.ANTI-SEMITISM  IS NOT merely one of many prejudices. It has unique features, the same ones that  characterize the demonization of Israel. Both are irrational obsessions  consisting entirely of grotesque lies and libels. Both accuse a group of people  of a conspiracy of evil of cosmic proportions. Both accuse those people of  committing abuses of which they are not only innocent, but are, in fact, the  victims.In Britain, there is virtually no reporting of the murderous  Palestinian attacks on Israelis occurring almost daily. There was no mention of  last year’s report by the committee of high-level military folk from nine  countries, including the US, France and Germany, which stated that the standard  the IDF set in protecting innocent Arab civilians during the 2014 Gaza conflict  was too high for any of their own countries to match.Instead, the  British media and politicians portrayed Israel in that conflict as the willful  killer of Palestinian children and civilians. They depict as callous aggression  Israel’s attempts to defend its population against mass murder. And then people  wonder why there is an eruption of Jew-bashing.In the past couple of  weeks, the media has begun to pay attention to the contribution made by British  and EU taxpayers to Palestinian Authority backing for terrorism.The  British still don’t understand, though, that the UK and Europe have long funded  and connived at not just Palestinian terrorism, but the incitement that causes  it.They don’t understand that this incitement is based on anti-Semitism,  not a dispute over land boundaries.They don’t understand that  anti-Semitism is the signature motif of a deranged culture that should be  treated as a pariah rather than excused, sanitized and rewarded, as Britain does  with the Palestinians.They don’t understand that the anti-Semitic  derangement that drives the Palestinians also drives the Muslim war against the  West.They don’t understand that by indulging the lies, intimidation and  moral inversion of Palestinian Jew-hatred, Britain and Europe have made it  impossible to fight off the Islamist threat to themselves.They will only  start to defend themselves properly when they start treating Israel as their  indispensable ally rather than a cosmic foe.

<title>As I see it: Palestinians step up the jihad of the lie</title>
<date>27/10/2016</date>
<content>
This week, UNESCO doubled down on its  shameful resolution erasing the historic connection of Judaism and Christianity  to the Temple Mount, the holy of holies of the Jewish people, defining it  instead as a “Muslim holy site of worship.”For good measure, the  original resolution also condemned the “escalating Israeli aggressions and  illegal measures” against the department in charge of Jerusalem’s Muslim holy  places and deplored “the continuous storming of Al-Aksa mosque/ Al-Haram  al-Sharif by Israeli right-wing extremists and uniformed forces.”




This  rewriting of Jewish history and religious belief amounts to a jihad of the  lie. The false claims of Israeli aggression, projecting the Arabs’ own  unceasing violence, cultural vandalism and terrorism over Temple Mount onto  their Jewish victims, are incendiary lies which fuel murderous attacks on Jews  and in which UNESCO has now made itself complicit.Of all the disturbing  issues of our time, the most fundamental is the collapse of the distinction  between truth and lies.When post-modern society decided that the notion  of objective truth was bunk and so everything was relative, it also destroyed  the idea of a lie. If there’s no such thing as truth, there can be no such thing  as a lie. Everything becomes merely a matter of opinion.Palestinian  leaders lie reflexively and unremittingly about Israel and the  Jews. Inflammatory libels that Israelis deliberately kill Arab children  or perpetrate ethnic cleansing and apartheid incite Arab mobs to murderous  rage.These lies are also believed by many in the West. For while only  some Westerners are consumed by anti-Jewish bigotry, most are no longer educated  to distinguish lies from factual evidence. They are taught instead to afford  equal respect to “competing narratives.”Profoundly ignorant about the  Middle East, many have thus swallowed the patently ridiculous lie that the Jews  have no historic connection to the land of Israel, whose indigenous people were  instead the Palestinians.Next year marks the centenary of the Balfour  Declaration, the letter written in 1917 by British Foreign Secretary Arthur  Balfour. This committed the UK government to establish a Jewish national home in  what was then called Palestine.As the latest front in their campaign to  delegitimize and destroy Israel, the Palestinians have now threatened to mark  this anniversary by a year-long campaign of fabrication and  distortion.Last July, the Palestinian Authority absurdly threatened to  sue the British government over the Balfour Declaration. PA “foreign  minister” Riyad al-Malki said it “gave people who don’t belong there something  that wasn’t theirs.”This is a lie. Israel has only ever belonged to the  Jews, the sole extant indigenous people of the land. This has been acknowledged  by Arabs themselves.In 1918 Sherif Hussein, the guardian of the Islamic  holy places in Arabia, wrote that the Jews streaming back to Palestine were  “exiles” returning to their “sacred and beloved homeland.” In March 1919 Emir  Faisal wrote: “We will wish the Jews a hearty welcome home.”A few days  ago in London, a campaign to get Britain to apologize “for its past colonial  crimes in Palestine” was launched at the House of Lords, no less, by the  Palestine Return Center.The meeting brought together “Jewish conspiracy”  theorists, Holocaust deniers and other Jew-haters in a display of open  antisemitism. The lies of antisemitism are fed by, and feed into, lies about  Israel.When he edited the Palestine Telegraph, the PRC’s Balfour  Declaration campaign coordinator, Sameh Habeeb, posted a video of former Ku Klux  Klan leader David Duke claiming that Israel is a terrorist threat to  America.Now the PRC claims that when the Balfour Declaration was written  “the indigenous Palestinians amounted to 90% of the total  population.”The claim that Britain gave a Palestinian country to the  Jews is a lie.On July 24 1922, the League of Nations unanimously gave  its recognition to “the historical connection of the Jewish people with  Palestine and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that  country.” As a result, it gave Britain a mandate to settle the Jews there as of  right.In 1917 the Arabs living in Palestine did not identify themselves  as Palestinians. They were either nomadic or identified with Arab  countries, such as Syria. When people referred to Palestinians in the first half  of the last century, they meant the Jews.The Jews are the only people  for whom the land of Israel was ever their national kingdom. It is the Arabs who  are bent upon a colonialist crime, seeking to steal the Jews’ land from them  once again.As ever, though, Israel’s government, with its swaggering,  macho refusal to deal strategically and forensically with the cognitive war  being waged against it, has responded merely with sarcasm and  outrage.Israel needs instead to educate the world in quite how unhinged  these lies are.For many in the West themselves don’t know the true facts  and so don’t understand that the Palestinians are motivated by a  madness.These lies prove unequivocally that the real agenda of even  so-called “moderate Palestinians” is to eradicate Israel. Their hostility  to the Jewish homeland is so pathological they perpetrate the most ludicrous  falsehoods to write the Jews out of their own history.
The Palestinians  think their big historical lie will finish Israel off. In fact it could rebound  on them badly and finish off their own cause – but only if Israel recognizes the  opportunity it should now seize.

<title>As I See It: Two cheers for Britain’s BDS ban</title>
<date>18/2/2016</date>
<content>
The British government has done something in support of Israel, and the  progressive intelligentsia is in shock. Prime Minister David Cameron is taking  action against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.New  government guidance will prevent any public body from imposing a boycott on a  member of the World Trade Organization to which Israel belongs.




Local  boycotts breach the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, which demands that all  suppliers are treated equally.The guidance aims at preventing publicly  funded bodies such as municipal councils or National Health Service trusts from  boycotting goods produced by what they believe to be “unethical companies,” such  as firms involved in arms trading, fossil fuels or tobacco products as well as  companies based in Israel.Matthew Hancock, the British government’s  Cabinet Office minister, revealed the development on a visit to Israel this  week. Such boycotts, he said, were divisive, potentially damaging to the UK’s  relationship with Israel and risked fueling anti-Semitism.The enemies of  Israel are beside themselves in fury.The British Labor Party has called  the guidance an “attack on democracy.” NGOs in the forefront of anti-Israel  activism, such as Amnesty, War on Want and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign,  have called it a “gross attack” on democratic freedoms and the ability of  councils or other public bodies to make “ethical investments.”The  British government’s initiative has understandably delighted Israel and its  supporters. They should nevertheless temper their jubilation.In its own  limited terms, the guidance is certainly justified. It merely restates existing  law and requires public bodies to comply. The boycott of Israel by public bodies  is a gross abuse of taxpayers’ money. The protests at the government initiative  are specious.Democracy does not require a local council or hospital  trust to busy itself in foreign policy matters. It does not require public  bodies to behave in a discriminatory manner by singling out Israel for treatment  afforded to no other country. And “ethical investment” hardly entails supporting  Palestinian dictatorships and the proposed ethnic cleansing of the Jews from  their own ancient homeland.The term “boycott” doesn’t do this justice.  BDS is a campaign of mass bullying and intimidation, sending threatening mobs  into supermarkets, lecture theaters and concert halls intent on harassment and  censorship under the guise of human rights – directed at further punishing the  victims of a century of exterminatory terrorism and war in the Middle  East.Many British Jews feel intimidated and threatened by BDS because  they understand it to be nothing less than the Western front in the war of  extermination directed at Israel.No other country is subjected to such a  campaign built on grotesque lies about its behavior designed to turn the  Israelis into devils in the Western public mind.No country, indeed, is  subjected to a boycott campaign based on the truth about its behavior. There is  no boycott campaign directed against Saudi Arabia, Iran, China or any of the  myriad states which oppress and subjugate their hapless  populations.There is no boycott campaign against either Hamas or the  Palestinian Authority which persecute and tyrannize their populations, jail  dissidents and throw homosexuals off the roofs of tall buildings. On the  contrary, these regimes are supported against Israel by the BDS brigade, who are  mute on the Palestinians’ abuse of each other let alone their hysterical  incitement against and mass murder of Israeli Jews.Apartheid in South  Africa was a real and demonstrable evil. When Jews hear that BDS against Israel  is modeled on the anti-apartheid campaign, the comparison turns their blood to  ice.That’s because accusing Israel of apartheid is a wicked and  manipulative lie deployed as a weapon of war by Israel’s enemies to portray it  as a rogue state which needs to be eliminated. BDS thus makes its Western  proponents complicit in the attempt to destroy the only state in the Middle East  which actually upholds human rights, and whose only crime is to exist at all as  the homeland of the Jewish people.Far from promoting human rights, BDS  seeks to deny them to the Jews alone. As its co-founder Omar Barghouti openly  declared, “We oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine.” As such, BDS is  directed not just at Israel but at the entire Jewish people.But the  Israel boycott is by no means the whole problem.BDS is to anti-Israel  lunacy what ISIS is to Islamic extremism: merely the noisiest and most  eye-watering manifestation of a deeply rooted and widespread lethal  contamination.The poison is incubated in the universities. This week,  the co-chairman of the Oxford University Labor Club, Alex Chalmers, announced he  was resigning over its rampant anti-Semitism and endorsement of Israel Apartheid  Week on campus.“Whether it be,” he wrote, “members of the executive  throwing around the term ‘Zio’ (a term for Jews usually confined to websites run  by the Ku Klux Klan) with casual abandon, senior members of the club expressing  their ‘solidarity’ with Hamas and explicitly defending their tactics of  indiscriminately murdering civilians, or a former co-chair claiming that ‘most  accusations of anti-Semitism are just the Zionists crying wolf,’ a large  proportion of both OULC and the student Left in Oxford more generally have some  kind of problem with Jews.”A further statement from the Oxford  University Jewish Society said senior members of the Labor Club liked to regale  listeners with a song called “Rockets over Tel Aviv” and endorsed Hamas attacks  on Israeli civilians, stated all Jews should be required to denounce Zionism and  the State of Israel, and said those who refused to do so should be shunned. And  they had arranged for a group of students to harass a Jewish student and shout  “Filthy Zionist” at her.Preventing BDS will not stamp out this deranged  animosity against Israel and Zionism that has now gripped most of the Labor  Party and Britain’s “progressive” intelligentsia.Indeed, the new  guidance may provide a fig leaf for the derangement to continue. The British  government can pose as a champion of Israel against delegitimization.But  that very same British government continues to propound one of the key lies  fueling Israel delegitimization: that its “occupation” and settlement of the  disputed territories is illegal.If David Cameron really wants to tackle  anti-Israel incitement, he should be telling the British public some  inconvenient truths – such as that the occupation and the settlements are legal  several times over; that in the entire Middle East it is only Israel that  upholds human rights for Arabs along with all its other citizens; that no decent  person should support the Palestinian agenda of anti-Israel incitement, Jewish  ethnic cleansing and the destruction of Israel; and that NGOs such as Amnesty  and War on Want are a disgrace for doing so.Alas, he will not do this.  Although he has moved sharply in the right direction over Israel, he hasn’t yet  joined up the dots. Or maybe he has, but isn’t brave enough to show his country  the completed picture.Unless he does so, however, his guidance will do  little to restore reason and decency to British public debate.

<title>Black Lives Matter must rescind anti-Israel declaration</title>
<date>17/8/2016</date>
<content>
It is a real tragedy that Black Lives Matter – which has done so much good in  raising awareness of police abuses – has now moved away from its central mission  and has declared war against the nation state of the Jewish people. In a  recently issued “platform,” more than 60 groups that form the core of the BLM  movement went out of their way to single out one foreign nation to accuse of  genocide and apartheid.No, it wasn’t the Syrian government, which has  killed tens of thousands of innocent people with barrel bombs, chemicals and  gas. Nor was it Saudi Arabia, which openly practices gender and religious  apartheid. It wasn’t Iran, which hangs gays and murders dissidents. It wasn’t  China, which has occupied Tibet for more than half a century.




And it  wasn’t Turkey, which has imprisoned journalists, judges and academics. Finally,  it wasn’t any of the many countries, such as Venezuela or Mexico, where police  abuses against innocent people run rampant and largely unchecked. Nor was it the  Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, where the police are a law unto themselves who act  as judge, jury and executioner of those whose politics or religious practices  they disapprove of.It was only Israel, the nation state of the Jewish  people and the only democracy in the Middle East. The platform accuses the US of  being “complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people” by  providing aid to “an apartheid state.”To be sure, BLM is not a  monolithic organization.It is a movement comprising numerous groups.  Many of its supporters have no idea what the platform says. They cannot be  faulted for supporting the movement or its basic mission. But the platform is  the closest thing to a formal declaration of principles by BLM. The genocide  paragraph may well have been injected by radicals who are not representative of  the mainstream, but now that it has officially been published, all decent  supporters of BLM – and there are many – must demand its  removal.Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitic. Like other democracies,  including our own, it has faults. Criticizing Israel’s settlement and occupation  policies is fair game. But singling Israel out and falsely accusing it of  “genocide” can be explained in no other way than blatant hatred of Jews and  their state.In defending its citizens against terrorism since before its  establishment as a state in 1948, Israel has killed fewer Palestinians than did  Jordan and Syria in two much shorter wars. The relatively low number of civilian  deaths caused by Israeli self-defense measures over the past 68 years compares  favorably to the number of civilian deaths in other conflicts. This is because,  as Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, put  it: there has been “no time in the history of warfare when an army has made more  efforts to reduce civilian casualties...than [the Israel Defense Forces].”  Though Kemp was specifically referring to the wars in the Gaza Strip – which are  also the apparent focus of the BLM platform – his conclusion is applicable to  all wars Israel has fought.Genocide means the deliberate extermination  of a race, such as done by Nazi Germany to Jews and Sinti and Roma, or by the  Hutu against the Tutsi in Rwanda. It has no application to deaths caused by  self-defense measures taken to protect citizens against terrorism. To falsely  accuse Israel of “genocide” – the worst crime of all, and the crime whose very  name was coined to describe the systematic murder of six million Jews – is  anti-Semitic.Until and unless BLM removes this blood libel from its  platform and renounces it, no decent person – black, white, or of any other  racial or ethnic background – should have anything to do with it. We should  continue to fight against police abuses by supporting other organizations or  forming new ones. But we must not become complicit in the promotion of  anti-Semitism just because we agree with the rest of the BLM program.To  support an organization or movement that promotes anti-Semitism because it also  supports good causes is the beginning of the road to accepting racism. Many  racist groups have also promoted causes that deserve support.The Black  Panthers had breakfast programs for inner-city children, while advocating  violence against whites. And the Ku Klux Klan organized summer camps for  working- class families, while advocating violence against blacks.There  must be zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, regardless of the race, religion,  gender, or sexual orientation of the bigots who promote, practice or are  complicit with it. Being on the right side of one racial issue does not give one  a license to be on the wrong side of the oldest bigotry.To give BLM a  pass on its anti-Jewish bigotry would be to engage in racism. Black  anti-Semitism is as inexcusable as white anti-Semitism or white racism. There  can be no double standard when it comes to bigotry.I write this column  both in sorrow and in anger. In sorrow because I support the goals of the BLM  movement – I have long been involved in efforts to expose and prevent police  abuses – and worry that this obnoxious and divisive platform plank may destroy  its credibility with regard to police abuse in America by promoting deliberate  lies about Israel. It is also alienating Jewish and other supporters who could  help them achieve their goals here at home – as many such individuals have  historically done in actively supporting all aspects of the civil rights  movement.I write it in anger because there is never an excuse for  bigotry and for promoting blood libels against the Jewish people and their  state. It must stop. And those who engage in it must be called out for  condemnation.Black Lives Matter should rescind the portions of the  platform that falsely accuse Israel of genocide and apartheid. If it does not,  it risks ending in the dustbin of history, along with other discredited bigoted  groups.It would be sad if the good work done by BLM were now to be  sidetracked by the mendacious and irrelevant accusation of “genocide” and  “apartheid” against one foreign democracy – Israel.

<title>Bottleneck: The naïve and the fool</title>
<date>12/5/2016</date>
<content>
Years ago, my brilliant professor of business administration, Boaz Ronen, used  to hold his hands out to the side in what he called the “weeping willow gesture”  and say to us captivated students, “What can you do?” It was his way of mocking  CEOs and their litany of excuses for the failures of their company, the list of  forces majeures they blamed it on. The bottom line was always the same: It’s not  our fault, it’s the result of objective circumstances.Prof. Ronen  specialized in identifying and clearing bottlenecks in businesses. “You can do  more with what you have,” he always said. Even complicated problems can be  solved in this way, by unclogging the pipes.




And if it doesn’t fix 100  percent of the problem, fixing 70 or 80% is better than nothing.Israel  isn’t a business, but the principle is the same. The national bottleneck, the  main threat to our future, is the persistent and still bleeding issue of the  Palestinians. I don’t intend to deal here with humanitarian questions; there is  more than one side to that coin. It’s enough to say that we live here because we  won, and they live here because we’re at least seven times more humanitarian  than they are. If they had won, not one of us would be left in this land. But  when certain freedoms of one side conflict with the right to life of the other  side, the problem is complex.In clearing the national bottleneck, we  should be guided by three principles: 1) Our survival must not be endangered.  The solution for the West Bank is not the same as the solution for Gaza – total  withdrawal is out of the question; 2) No binational state. That’s like pudding  with sardines, a fried egg with chocolate, or a bomb affixed to the car of a  mafia boss – they don’t go well together.It won’t get very far before it  blows up; and 3) No apartheid. That’s just not us. It’s like sexual harassment –  it was repulsive and indefensible even before there was a law against it, but  now you go to prison for it. Apartheid may have managed to hold its own in the  previous century, but today it’s a thing of the past, and good riddance to it.  It shouldn’t – and couldn’t – be allowed to return.The naïve and the  fool are relatives who live side by side. Anyone who thinks we can reach a  final, comprehensive agreement with the Palestinians falls under at least one of  these categories. The same goes for those who claim, “Even though there’s no  chance of success, we have to keep trying.” What’s the point of treading water?  The ones who say, “We’ll agree to a Palestinian state only on condition that...”  are also basically arguing for a continued standstill. The problem is that the  “standstill” isn’t really standing still. It’s leading us to infringement of  principles (2) and (3) above, and ultimately of principle (1) as  well.What we need is something different.It may not solve 100%  of the problem, because there is no perfect solution, but it will be better than  what we have. “The enemy of ‘good’ is ‘very good,’” Prof. Ronen used to say. But  as things stand, “good” is definitely good enough.Our partners to the  solution are the Americans and other friendly nations, and not the Palestinians  who are masters of deception. Despite what they may say, they don’t want their  own impoverished country; they want to be part of our prosperous one. What needs  to be done is to declare a Palestinian state within temporary borders, a state  with which we have a territorial dispute. The rest of the issues can be  discussed by the club members after we have buried the mother of all our  problems. If the Palestinians don’t agree to a state of their own right here and  now, their true face will be revealed for all to see.

<title>Candidly Speaking: Abusing the term ‘fascism’ in relation to Israel</title>
<date>25/7/2016</date>
<content>
It is now a worldwide phenomenon that left-wingers and increasing numbers of  liberals chant the mantra that Israel is led by extremists and becoming  transformed into a full-fledged fascist state. Unfortunately, such unadulterated  nonsense is expressed daily and is highlighted in Haaretz, illustrating the  primitive measures even Jewish opponents of our government are willing to take  in order to demonize the Jewish state.Their defamation includes  accusations of war crimes and deliberate killing of children, applying apartheid  to the Arab Israeli minority, suppressing freedom of expression, maintaining an  occupation and denying Palestinian statehood. In a nutshell – a fascist  regime.




Joseph Goebbels demonstrated that if one constantly repeats a  lie, people begin to accept the lie as truth.My objective, without  suggesting that we are perfect, is to briefly identify and rebut such lies and  demonstrate that there is no country in the world that surpasses the level of  democracy by which Israel is governed.In addition, the extraordinary  success of Israel’s democratic system is all the more impressive because it was  achieved despite facing major obstacles.From its inception, Israel has  been surrounded by states committed to its destruction. These neighbor states  are notorious for denying basic human rights to their own citizens and in most  cases are Islamic dictatorships. Over the past five years, the region has  reverted to the Dark Ages with hundreds of thousands being killed and millions  displaced in intra-Arab conflicts. In this context, Israel represents an oasis  of stability and peace.Israel has been obliged to allot a greater  proportion of its budget for defense than any other nation.It is  situated on the global front lines combating terrorism and must be in permanent  readiness to face wars from its fanatical adversaries who remain committed to  terminating Jewish sovereignty.Israel is a young country that was  created as a haven for Jews living under oppression or  discrimination.The bulk of its founding population were survivors of the  Holocaust, Jews escaping persecution from Arab countries, Russian Jews and  others fleeing oppression. They range from sophisticated Russian scientists to  Ethiopian farmers. Yet this motley amalgam of Jews from all corners of the world  became integrated into an extraordinary nation and nurtured an exemplary  democratic state.The current government is accused of being fascist and  blamed for the failed peace process. The fact that Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu has offered concessions far beyond the red lines prime minister  Yitzhak Rabin vowed he would never cross, and has offered to negotiate without  preconditions, has been repeatedly ignored.The majority of Europeans  believe that Israel is a fascist state carrying out ghoulish genocidal policies  against the Palestinians and even make obscene analogies between Israel’s  self-defense and Nazi behavior. That is a true extension of medieval blood  libels.The accusations of racism and apartheid are bizarre. There are  social and economic gaps between Jews and Arabs that require improvement. But  Israeli Arabs enjoy freedom of expression, elect their own Knesset members and  Arab judges even preside in the Supreme Court. Indeed, visiting an Israeli  hospital, shopping mall or park provides a case study in  integration.Another ludicrous lie is that fascist forces are rapidly  destroying freedom of expression. Much of this emanates from delusional far-left  elements and is highlighted in Haaretz, which is probably the most effective  source of anti-Israeli propaganda for our global adversaries. When the culture  minister said she would no longer provide public funds for “cultural” activities  that principally vilify Israel, she was accused of fascism. When the education  minister refused to include in the school curriculum a controversial novel  containing praise for Hamas that would offend many Israelis, that too was  labeled fascism. The education minister was also accused of fascism for denying  entry into schools to Breaking the Silence, an organization that promotes global  campaigns besmirching the IDF with anonymous accusations of war  crimes.The Supreme Court generates both pride and anger. Pride because  it is a powerful instrument challenging abuse but also anger because it is  undoubtedly the most interventionist High Court in any democracy. It is  frequently accused of excessively blocking legislative processes. It would  certainly not qualify for inclusion in a fascist state.There is  unbridled freedom of expression. When institutions such as universities, funded  by taxpayers and Zionist philanthropists, are used as platforms to undermine the  legitimacy of the state, many sober Israelis have called for tougher legislation  related to subversion and treason. Could one visualize any other government  under siege that would tolerate outbursts such as those of MK Haneen Zoabi  identifying with those seeking Israel’s destruction? Imagine how Winston  Churchill would have reacted if a British politician publicly defended the  Nazis. Yet Israel is accused of restricting freedom of expression.It is  alleged that Israel’s settlement policies breach international law and are thus  also condemned as manifestations of fascist ideology. Yet aside from Jerusalem,  these settlements consist of less than three percent of territories previously  occupied by Jordan. Today, the only place in the civilized world where a Jew is  considered a criminal for building or extending a home is in Judea, Samaria and  east Jerusalem – which our adversaries insist must be Judenrein irrespective of  what is ultimately determined in relation to the disputed territories. We are  told that a Jew building a second bedroom in a legitimately purchased apartment  in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem is a war criminal and represents an  obstacle to peace.The latest objection relates to the recent legislation  requiring transparency for funds directed toward Israeli nongovernmental  organizations by foreign governments. These NGOs played a prominent role in  disseminating lies about Israel, seeking to depict it as a fascist state,  accusing it of war crimes, apartheid, genocide, and some even promoting the  boycott movement. These so-called human rights organizations have provided huge  sums of money and maintain a massive network to promote their agenda of  demonization and delegitimization of Israel. It is unprecedented that purported  friendly foreign governments pour huge sums into NGOs seeking to besmirch and  overthrow our democratically elected government.The government is  responding by obliging any NGO receiving the bulk of its funds from foreign  governments to provide disclosure. This represents a symbolic gesture and the  howls of denying freedom of speech (which is not involved) and renewed  accusations of fascism are hollow. The greatest chutzpah was the reaction of  American and European lawmakers condemning Israel for such a move.It  would be inconceivable for any of these governments to stand by and fail to  react if their neighbors were pouring in funds to local NGOs to demonize and  vilify them.To sum up, despite the overwhelming challenges, Israel  remains one of the liveliest democracies in the world.Little can be done  to change the behavior of our enemies. The anti-Semitic Islamists, the  delusional Left and conventional anti-Semites will continue to pursue, through  the hostile media and the Internet, the perennial accusation that Jews – or  today, the Jewish state – are the source of all evil.What is  disconcerting is that with US President Barack Obama’s encouragement, much of  this propaganda is beginning to penetrate American liberal circles, including  some people who were deeply supportive of Israel. This already includes the left  wing of the Democratic Party, and there are ominous signals that bipartisanship  in the US may not survive the onslaught.It thus essential to constantly  speak out and refute the lies and communicate with open-minded liberals,  especially young people, to prevent them from being drawn into the left-wing  anti-Israeli maelstrom where they can be brainwashed into believing the lies  about Israelis becoming fascists.
That will not be achieved by remaining  silent or obsessively maintaining a bipartisan relationship by accepting the  lowest common denominator.

<title>Candidly Speaking: Anglo Jewry confronts Labour anti-Semitic surge</title>
<date>13/4/2016</date>
<content>
Ten years ago, I was accused of pandering to hysteria when I praised Melanie  Phillips’ groundbreaking book, Londonistan, detailing the alarming growth of  anti-Semitism in the UK and predicting further deterioration unless the British  government drastically altered its approach.Many British Jews,  especially those living in Jewish enclaves, were in denial, simply unwilling to  face reality.




Their attitude is brilliantly portrayed in Howard  Jacobson’s 2010 Man Booker Prize-winning novel, The Finkler Question, which  satirically portrays a British Jew desperately seeking to become socially  acceptable.The Anglo Jewish establishment has frequently been referred  to as “trembling Israelites.” They were “shtadlanim” (court Jews) who, to quote  a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, crafted a policy  based on “Why must one shout when a whisper can be heard?” Their overriding  concern was to avoid rocking the boat by minimizing public protest wherever  possible.Those who assailed Phillips as an extremist 10 years ago today  would concede that her analysis has been absolutely vindicated, and alas, her  predictions of intensifying anti-Semitism were understated.Who then  would have dreamed that the alternate government in the UK – the Labour Party –  would not only be riddled with anti-Semites, but would elect a leader, Jeremy  Corbyn, who praises Hamas; maintains that Hamas and Hezbollah are committed to  peace; calls for a boycott of Israel; accepts Islamic demonization of Israel;  and associates with Holocaust denier Paul Eisen, whom he defends as “far from a  dangerous man”; and endorses Raed Salah, who employed the medieval blood libel  to justify Palestinian terrorism? It should therefore not be surprising that  Corbyn refuses to purge the increasingly vocal anti-Semites from his party,  despite widespread media exposure and repeated pleas from distraught  members.Jews are also shocked with the extension of this hatred which  has penetrated leading universities, including Oxford. The depiction by Alex  Chalmers, former head of the Oxford University Labour Club, of the anti-Semitism  he encountered and the support of Hamas that obliged him to resign, is chilling.  The Sunday Times disclosed that during the TV coverage of funerals for those  murdered in the Paris kosher supermarket, the members mocked the Jewish victims,  sang songs about rockets over Tel Aviv and related to Auschwitz as a “cash cow”  for Jews.Not surprisingly, many Jewish students feel  intimidated.To retain their social standing, a number choose to endorse  the anti-Zionist chic. Others recuse themselves.Some argue that Jewish  student bodies should not even engage in Israel advocacy and should restrict  themselves to religious, cultural and social activities.Although Jews  living in predominately Jewish areas are less affected, there has been an  exponential growth of public anti-Semitic incidents, including acts of  violence.Today in Britain there is open chatter that the creation of  Israel was a mistake and there are intensifying calls to end the “apartheid  Jewish state.”These events have shattered the myth that anti-Semitism in  the UK is restricted to Muslims and fringe indigenous elements. The BBC is not  controlled by Islamists but its extreme bias and double standards have molded  public opinion toward the demonization of Israel. Much of the anti-Israelism  that initially emanated from Trotskyite elements has now become intrinsic to the  DNA of many left-wingers. The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is  primarily promoted by indigenous leftist activists.Indeed, in some  respects the situation is worse than the 1930s, when at least liberal and  left-wing groups defended the Jews. Admittedly, the current prime minister,  David Cameron, is a friend of Israel and the Jewish people, but opinion polls  indicate that half the population considers Israel a rogue state. In a  democracy, such trends ultimately impact on policy.The current communal  leadership is responding courageously, in contrast to its predecessors. Last  year, the Board of Deputies elected as its 47th president Jonathan Arkush, a  traditional Jew and a passionate Zionist, who dismissed the “court Jew” policy  of relying almost exclusively on “silent diplomacy.”He was, from the  outset, respectfully outspoken in his condemnation of Labour Party leader  Corbyn’s failure to confront anti-Jewish bigotry in his party.Indeed,  Arkush could well serve as a role model for many American Jewish leaders who in  the past made a point of ridiculing British leaders for their timidity, but have  been singularly silent in relation to President Barack Obama’s outbursts against  Israel.Arkush stated: “If Labour is to be credible in exorcising its  anti-Semitic demons, its leader must first clearly demonstrate that these  relationships are problematic.”He added: “Failing to oppose terrorism at  the Jewish community by the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah; singing a song called  ‘Rockets over Tel Aviv’; indicating support for the Holocaust or denying it  happened; denying or finding excuses for the problem of contemporary  anti-Semitism; indulging in theological anti-Semitism – tying the current  problems in the Middle East to prejudices about Jews learned from the texts or  traditions of Christianity or Islam; repeating Jewish conspiracy theories about  malevolent Jewish power and control, including the ‘blood libel’ – all these  things should be obviously unacceptable behavior. But sadly, they have not been  obvious enough to some.”Last week, Corbyn defended his brother Piers,  who dismissed allegations of anti-Semitism as “absurd,” claiming that “Zionists  can’t cope with anyone supporting rights for Palestine.” Corbyn’s defense of  Piers’ remarks is all the more problematic considering they were uttered  directly in aftermath of the exposure of a number of incendiary anti-Semitic  outbursts by Labour politicians. For example: • Labour’s shadow chancellor John  McDonnell’s website was exposed as having “paid tribute to suicide bombers,”  shared links to websites promoting boycott of Israeli goods, compared Israelis  to Nazis and hosted an article stating that Israel should be  “dismantled.”Only after media exposure did McDonnell withdraw the  offending websites.• Labour MP Vicki Kirby implied that there was a  sinister reason for Islamic State (ISIS) failing to attack “the real  oppressors,” Israel, stated Adolf Hitler could be regarded as a “Zionist God”  and that Jews have big noses.• Labour MP Gerry Downing was expelled from  the party for the second time, but only after Prime Minister Cameron drew  attention to his views, which included re-opening “the Jewish Question” and  stating that terrorism was the legitimate response of the oppressed.•  Former Labour mayor of Bradford Khaddim Hussain condemned Holocaust education  and accused Israel of arming ISIS.• A Labour councilor in Luton, Aysegul  Gurbuz, last week referred to Hitler “as the greatest man in history” and  expressed the hope that a nuclear Iran “would wipe Israel off the  map.”Arkush described Corbyn’s insistence that his brother was “not  wrong” in dismissing allegations of anti-Semitism as “belittling” the issue and  “deeply disturbing.” He stated: “We cannot imagine any other minority’s concerns  would be dismissed in this way. In the last few weeks, we have witnessed a  stream of clearcut cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party which can’t just  be fobbed off as differences over Israel. Most of the Jewish community, numerous  Labour peers, and Labour’s London mayoral candidate are crying out for their  leader to take action on anti-Semitism. It would be incomprehensible for Mr.  Corbyn to remain inert and refuse to take this form of racism in his party  seriously.” He stated explicitly that “frankly, most people in the Jewish  community can’t trust Labour.”Although a few hard-core Jewish Labour  supporters have criticized Arkush for publicly stating that Jews were losing  trust in the party, the majority of Jewish leftists unequivocally condemned  Corbyn’s attitude and were no less damning of the rampant anti-Semitism in the  party than the board president.One might hope that public exposure would  shame Labour leaders into taking remedial action. Stephen Pollard, editor of the  Jewish Chronicle, is pessimistic. He noted: “If your politics are  anti-imperialist, nothing else matters. So Mr. Corbyn happily describes Hamas  and Hezbollah representatives as ‘friends,’ despite their penchant for murdering  Jews... and with the party leader openly – proudly – alongside these people,  anti-Semites swarm to Labour, assured of a warm welcome from their fellow  anti-imperialists. This isn’t political debate – it’s racism. And it’s Labour’s  racism.”British Jews should unite and support their lay  leadership.These shocking developments affect all Jews, bridging the  entire political spectrum, secular and religious, ultra-Orthodox to  Reform.According to the Daily Mail, over the past two decades, Jewish  support for Labour has plummeted from 70 percent to 25%. In last May’s general  election, it was reported that Jews contributed a third of the 9.7 million  pounds donated (approximately $13.7 million) to Labour by private donors. This  year, no major Jewish donor contributed.If Arkush has the support of the  community and if the so-called “Jewish Leadership Council,” an unelected body  mainly comprising wealthy Jews, which frequently undermines the representative  role of the Board of Deputies, sets aside personal egos and backs the elected  Jewish community leadership, Anglo Jewry will act with dignity and maximize its  ability to reverse the tide.
At the very least, the leadership will  demonstrate to the next generation how, as proud Jews, they will not be  intimidated or run for cover but stand up for their rights.

<title>Candidly Speaking: Exposing the criminal society and the culture of death</title>
<date>24/8/2016</date>
<content>
We are losing the battle in the war of ideas for the simple reason that we are  continuously on the defensive while those seeking our destruction actively and  relentlessly demonize us.Ever since the Oslo Accords, successive Israeli  governments have felt obliged to understate and even dismiss Palestinian  terrorism and hatred in order to maintain domestic public support for policies  that, with the benefit of hindsight, were doomed to fail.




In the very  early stages, Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat told his people that  the ultimate goal was the end of Jewish sovereignty – and we dismissed such  outbursts as empty words designed merely to placate his radical domestic  opponents.But as the government falsely praised our peace partner, many  Israelis deluded themselves into believing that the terrorism we faced was an  extremist aberration and that the Palestinians were committed to ending the  conflict on the basis of a two-state solution. Likewise, most of the world  accepted at face value our repeated praise of Arafat and his successor, Mahmoud  Abbas, as moderates and genuine peace partners.This suited the long-term  Palestinian policy of destroying us in stages. They readily accepted concessions  and withdrawals but without compromising one iota, and they continue to demonize  us and challenge our legitimacy.But the worst aspect was our failure to  highlight the poisonous brainwashing the PA had inflicted on its population.  While Arab hostility to Jews prevailed even during the British Mandate period,  it was not comparable to the culture of death and evil that today saturates  every aspect of Palestinian life.The Palestinians have stated explicitly  that their state would be Judenrein and that Jews would never be permitted to  live in their ancestral home even if they were willing to accept Palestinian  jurisdiction.Indeed, Palestinians were brutally executed when they were  deemed to have sold land to a Jew.The PA has become a criminal society  and can be compared to prewar Germany, when the Nazis transformed their  population into genocidal barbarians by depicting Jews as subhuman. The  Palestinians depict Jews as “the offspring of apes and pigs” and call for their  extermination. This is not even done subtly but with blatant statements to this  effect emanating daily from religious and political leaders and accessible from  vast documentary sources compiled by Palestinian Media Watch, MEMRI and  others.A society in which children from kindergarten are brainwashed  into believing that the highest goal in Islam is to achieve martyrdom in the  course of killing Jews can only be described as criminal.The  demonization of Israel and manifestations of the culture of death are promoted  without inhibition by the leadership, the mullahs in the mosques and the  state-controlled media. They amount to direct incitement for individuals to  strike out and kill Jews in concert or randomly. The “heroic” scenes of  youngsters stabbing Jews, the praise by Abbas himself of martyrs “with holy  blood” and the totally contrived religious frenzy over accusations of Israelis  planning to destroy al-Aksa mosque, coalesce into a witch’s brew of primeval  rage and hatred.The PA provides generous state salaries to terrorists  apprehended by Israelis, and if they are killed, their families are remunerated  – from funds provided by Western countries. Religious and political leadership  at all levels sanctifies terrorists as heroes and national martyrs. City  squares, schools and even football clubs are named in their honor.The  barbarism imbibed by the Palestinians is reflected in the street celebrations  that erupt spontaneously with every murder of an Israeli. Even more nauseating  are the repeated displays on TV of mothers expressing pride at their children  becoming martyrs, and expressing hope that their other children will follow the  example.Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that Palestinian  opinion polls reflect public support for terrorist attacks against Israel and  opposition to a two-state solution. The Arafat/Abbas indoctrination process has  radicalized successive generations into believing that the only solution to the  conflict is the permanent termination of Jewish sovereignty in the  area.There is irrefutable evidence of the barbaric and genocidal nature  of Palestinian society. Indeed, the reality is that, despite maintaining a  “moderate” stance to the outside world, internally the Palestinians and ISIS are  birds of a feather – although the Palestinians are probably more  corrupt.Alongside the turbulence in the region and the threat from Iran  and ISIS, could one envisage any country agreeing to accept statehood for what  will inevitably be a neighboring criminal state pledged to its destruction or a  candidate for an ISIS or Iranian takeover? This would be utterly  inconceivable.Yet most of the international community, including the  United States, regards this as an issue of two nations arguing over real estate.  Were that the case, the Palestinians would not have dismissed the offers by  prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, who were willing to concede up to 97  percent of the territories formerly controlled by the Jordanians.Israel  has been the target of repeated defamation and delegitimization yet has  basically only been on the defensive, seeking to refute the lies being  disseminated against it. But as Joseph Goebbels said, if one repeats a lie  continuously, people begin believing it. This dictum has now been realized; many  in the Western world have absorbed the distorted Palestinian narrative of Israel  being an apartheid state, an occupier and a nation born in  sin.Ironically, the weakness of our position lies in the fact that,  until recently, in order to appease our allies and “protect” Israelis from being  confronted with the stark reality, we deliberately held back from telling the  truth and failed to highlight the barbaric and criminal nature of our purported  peace partner.Had we mounted campaigns at the outset, exposing the  horrors perpetrated by our neighbors, it may not have influenced anti-Semites  and the delusional Left but it would have made a significant impact on the  open-minded.But even now, belatedly exposing the barbarity of our  neighbors should be made the top priority in our foreign relations efforts  rather than the endless disputes over whether the minuscule 2% of territory  comprising settlements (which are not being expanded) is justified.The  recent initiative by Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman to establish relations  with independent Palestinians, aside from not having cabinet approval, is bound  to fail because any Palestinian engaged in such negotiations will immediately be  assassinated.Pressure must be exerted to encourage rank-and-file  Palestinians that their best interests will be served when they appoint leaders  who genuinely support the peace process. Alas, for the time being, that is not  even on the horizon.Today, we must move forward and promote a focused  effort to document and expose the evil nature of Palestinian society, which will  make it far more difficult and embarrassing for the Americans and Europeans to  continue pressuring Israel to accept the creation of what will invariably be a  criminal state – particularly in the context of the mayhem prevailing in the  region and the terrorist threats now impacting the heartland of  Europe.

<title>Global chaos – a byproduct of the failure to confront evil</title>
<date>20/7/2016</date>
<content>
A generation ago, the word “evil” had meaning.There were no bleeding  hearts – certainly no Jews – who minimized the malevolence of the Nazis. Evil  was evil.




Today, as moral relativism dominates, the world has effectively  abandoned the concept of evil, replacing it with a “sophisticated” political  correctness in which aggressors and victims are frequently considered moral  equivalents. For example, critics of Islamic terrorism are accused of  Islamophobia.There is “shock” at the mass murders and beheadings by  Islamic fundamentalists but we are told that it is misleading to describe such  behavior as “evil” because this diverts attention from the real source –  colonial exploitation. We also repeatedly hear the mantra that social and  economic suffering cause desperation and provide the incentive for jihadi  recruitment. Yet the majority of Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists operating in  Western cities are university graduates from middle class  families.Moreover the Western governments whose countries now face  terrorist attacks from “sleepers” and home-bred ISIS supporters bury their heads  in the sand and refuse to face the reality of the evil enemy of Islamic  fundamentalism incubated in Muslim communities whose rank and file is unwilling  or fearful to expose the jihadists in their midst.At the core of this is  the refusal to identify and confront the Islamic fundamentalist threat as a  global evil seeking to destroy the Judeo-Christian moral heritage and substitute  democracy with Sharia law or the caliphate.This evasion of using  concepts such as good and evil is evidenced by the treatment of Israel which, in  this context, is truly the canary in the coal mine and spotlights the global  descent into amorality.Thus for example: • Israel is the only democracy  in the Middle East region – a society based on law and equality and unqualified  freedom of expression. Despite hostile Arab neighbors seeking its destruction,  it provides full political equality to all its citizens, Arab and Jew alike.  Visit a hospital, shopping mall or park here to appreciate how outrageous it is  to employ terms like apartheid in Israel.Contrast this with the  Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas, where basic human rights are denied and  where a criminal society promotes terrorism.Their mullahs glorify  “shaheeds,” martyrs, and mothers proudly boast about their martyred children on  TV and express the hope that more of their offspring will follow  suit.The PA and Hamas provide substantial pensions to families of those  killed while murdering Jews or jailed in Israeli prisons. Schools, city squares  and football clubs are named in their honor. Moreover, every time a Jew is  murdered, spontaneous celebrations erupt in Palestinian streets. Truly a culture  of death.Yet the global community continuously applies moral equivalence  to Israel democracy and the criminal Palestinian society. Evil is  ignored.• Two Israeli prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, were  rebuffed by Yasser Arafat and PA President Mahmoud Abbas when they offered the  Palestinians 97 percent of the territories previously occupied by the  Jordanians. The “right wing” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made far more  extensive concessions than Yitzhak Rabin was ever willing to contemplate,  including support for a two-state policy subject to security guarantees and  Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state. The Palestinian objective  remains to terminate Jewish sovereignty in stages by demanding concessions  without any reciprocity.Yet the global community – headed by the Obama  administration – at best blamed both sides equally for the breakdown in  negotiations but usually held Israel responsible. Again, a denial of evil and  the application of moral equivalence.• The Middle East region is  reminiscent of the Dark Ages, with half a million innocent civilians butchered  and over four million displaced from their homes. Instead of addressing these  atrocities, the Obama administration leads the pack in demonizing Israelis for  home construction in Jewish neighborhoods.This obsession over  “settlements,” which other than Jerusalem comprise 3% of the territories  formerly administered by the Jordanians, is utterly bizarre. Nobody would argue  that an Israeli Arab is prohibited from building on property he  purchased.However, Jews who bought land legitimately over the so-called  Green Line are criminalized. How grotesque it is that an Israeli extending a  terrace in his Jerusalem home could lead to sanctions while a few kilometers  away, murder and mayhem continue unabated.• Western leaders and media  display cowardice when they grovel to the Islamists in their reporting of  terrorist atrocities with their implications that terrorist acts like the  stabbing to death of a 13-yearold girl in her bed in Israel are “resistance to  occupation.”It is despicable when US and European representatives remain  silent at the UN as the PA president receives standing ovations after delivering  his blood libels against Israel and denies any connection between Jews and  Jerusalem. When they support or abstain from UN resolutions demonizing or  delegitimizing the Jewish state, they become active accomplices to  evil.Moral equivalence – which is the order of the day in relation to  Israel – was a precursor to a global collapse of confidence among rank-and-file  masses in democratic countries.In all likelihood, history will define as  the turning point in the Islamification of Europe the German-led EU absorption  of millions of “refugees” from the Middle East – who ironically had been  rejected as security risks by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.Most of  these migrants have been educated against democracy and are fanatically  anti-Semitic. Their humiliation of women and major criminal elements are  downplayed by governments and media. Their presence will fortify the existing  Islamic concentrations in major European cities and permanently alter  demographics.The refusal and failure to confront the evil enemy of  Islamic fundamentalism has undermined global political stability and generated  chaos and grassroots revolt against the establishment. In the US, the level of  pre-electoral discourse has descended to an all-time low. The same applies to  European countries, with Brexit signaling the possible disintegration of the EU.  There is a surge of nationalistic and right-wing political parties as people  watch in horror as their societies are engulfed by Islamists and face terrorism  on their doorsteps – the latest being the horrific massacre in Nice, France with  over 80 killed.There is light at the end of the tunnel. Ultimately, the  grass-roots upheavals will hopefully create a global wakeup call and result in  more responsible and courageous leadership that will unequivocally combat  evil.In that context, Israel has never been as strong as it is today. It  is able to assert itself and will hopefully be recognized as a constructive and  valued partner in the global war against Islamic fundamentalism and cease to be  the scapegoat for the failure of resolve by the current global  leadership.The writer’s website can be viewed at  www.wordfromjerusalem.com.

<title>CANDIDLY SPEAKING: Has the ADL lost the plot?</title>
<date>16/8/2016</date>
<content>
I rubbed my eyes with incredulity when I read the bizarre statements emanating  from Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), one of  the most powerful American Jewish organizations whose principal mandate is to  combat anti-Semitism.A few months ago I was drawn into a heated dispute  with Greenblatt after criticizing an address he delivered to J Street students  which included implicit criticisms of Israeli government policy and a failure to  urge J Street to cease demonizing Israel and canvassing the US government to  intensify pressure against the Jewish state.




Instead, he should have  encouraged them to engage in the battle against the mushrooming anti-Semitism  proliferating on campus. Greenblatt responded that he was “impressed” with these  students and felt that they were “the future Jewish leaders of our  community.”But more recently, Greenblatt appears to have entirely lost  the plot, behaving as though he remained employed by the Obama  administration.He was entirely out of line in his condemnation of the  Republican platform as “anti-Zionist” for omitting reference to a two-state  solution.One can disagree about a two-state policy, but for an American  Jewish organization which must remain bipartisan and should be concentrating on  anti-Semitism, to issue such a statement breaches all conventions. It is totally  beyond the ADL’s mandate to involve itself in such partisan political  issues.Greenblatt is clearly obsessed with the subject of being “open  minded” and tolerant of anti-Israeli groups. He made the extraordinary statement  that, while disagreeing with Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) groups which  promote anti-Semitism, he considers that they are “animated by a desire for  justice” and says we should “acknowledge the earnestness of their motives.” One  is tempted to remind him that Islamic fundamentalists are also sincere in their  beliefs and equally animated by their perverted concept of justice.But  the final straw is Greenblatt’s deepening association with the Black Lives  Matter (BLM) movement.Jews have a long and proud tradition of direct  engagement in the civil rights campaign, in the course of which some even  sacrificed their lives, making it all the more regrettable that since 1967, many  African American groups have been at the forefront of campaigns against  Israel.The ADL mandate is to combat all forms of racial discrimination,  and endorsing legitimate civil rights groups is commendable. However, the recent  manifesto released by Black Lives Matter has clear anti-Semitic overtones. This  should not come as a surprise to anyone. Last year, BLM endorsed a “Black  Solidarity Statement with Palestine” which demonized Israel, accusing it of  “ethnic cleansing,” “genocide,” apartheid, etc., and called on all black  institutions to engage in BDS. Black Lives Matter is engaged in anti-Israeli  demonstrations, teach-ins and other activities, even including visits to Israel  to protest the “ethnic cleansing” and “occupation.” It likened New York police  behavior with alleged Israeli brutality against Palestinians, and in Atlanta,  BLM accused Israeli counter-terrorist training of American police forces as  being responsible for the shootings of black Americans.Yet despite pleas  and warnings, Greenblatt continues to associate the ADL and by implication the  Jewish community with the Black Lives Matter movement. Incredibly, in his J  Street address he stated that “making sure that Black Lives Matter ... are the  struggles of our time.”The ADL did criticize BLM’s accusations of  genocide and apartheid and its promotion of BDS against Israel. But Greenblatt  downplayed and marginalized the anti-Semitic elements to the initiatives “of a  small minority of leaders” within the organization, and stated that “Israel is  far from a principal focal point in the more than 40,000 word  document.”While contending that the ADL did not “endorse” or have a  formal relationship with BLM, Greenblatt refused to break with it. Thus, as of  now, he insists that the ADL continue to endorse and promote BLM domestic  educational material in its curriculum resources and family discussion guides in  schools and elsewhere because its concerns “are critical civil rights issues  that merit attention.” To the best of my knowledge, Greenblatt also failed to  publicly condemn the vicious lies and anti-Israeli statements made by the BLM  group which visited Israel last month.For any mainstream Jewish  organization to continue providing legitimacy to a purported civil rights body  which includes BDS and anti-Semitism in its policies on the grounds that only “a  small minority of leaders” are responsible is unconscionable. For an  organization like the ADL whose principal mandate is to combat anti-Semitism, it  is sheer lunacy.Furthermore, when Congressman Hank Johnson, a black  Democrat notorious for his hostility toward Israel, referred to Jews living in  Judea and Samaria as “termites” – a foul anti-Semitic expression – Greenblatt,  who was willing to condemn the Republicans for not relating to a two-state  policy, saw fit to merely tweet: “This is an offensive and unhelpful  characterization. Demonization, dehumanization of settlers doesn’t advance  peace.” Such a timid response to this outrageous expression from American  Jewry’s purported premier body designated to combat anti-Semitism is  incomprehensible.This is taking place at a time when anti-Semitism and  demonization of Israel on American campuses, under the guise of human rights,  has mushroomed with some campuses being described as cesspools of anti-Semitism.  That is the principal issue on which the ADL (and other major Jewish  organizations) should now be concentrating.It is also disconcerting  that, aside from the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), Jewish organizations  have shrouded themselves in a curtain of silence and failed to dissociate  themselves from this craven ADL approach.Incredibly Greenblatt actually  directed his ire at the ZOA rather than the anti-Semites. He proclaimed to the  Jewish Telegraphic Agency that “We are a civil rights organization. The ZOA is  not. We are an organization focused on combating anti-Semitism and bigotry. The  ZOA are not.”The ADL even castigated a Jewish newspaper for having the  effrontery to publish ZOA chief Mort Klein’s justified criticism of ADL for  failing to sever its links with BLM, claiming that such remarks amounted to  “hate speech.”In other words, the ADL had the chutzpa to declare that  the ZOA (which has played a major role in combating the demonization of Israel  and anti-Semitism) has no right to express its dissent or criticism of the  ADL.This is a fundamentally serious issue for American Jewish  leadership. If mainstream Jewish organizations remain silent and fail to  criticize the ADL’s reprehensible behavior they will be ushering in a new era in  which American Jewry’s hard-fought achievements and status in society will be  severely undermined.If the CEO of the ADL continues engaging in such  partisan politics and refuses to prioritize his organization’s principal  resources toward fighting anti-Semitism, he should step down. Otherwise the $50  million plus ADL budget is likely to be dramatically reduced when supporters and  donors recognize that the organization purporting to combat anti-Semitism is  primarily focusing its efforts on seeking liberal acceptance by pursuing  progressive agendas, denouncing conservatives, combating Islamophobia and  becoming engaged in universal issues and social justice at the expense of its  core mandate. These issues are handled by human rights bodies which individual  Jews can support as they deem appropriate.The ADL central mandate must  be to combat anti-Semitism, which is today largely manifested in the  demonization and delegitimization of Israel. If they elect to abandon this  objective, they do not warrant Jewish communal support.

<title>Candidly Speaking: The accelerating erosion of the post-Zionist Hebrew media</title>
<date>31/8/2016</date>
<content>
Haaretz, Israel’s oldest Hebrew daily newspaper, was established in 1918 by a group of left-leaning businessmen. In 1937, Salman Schocken bought the newspaper and it was edited by his son Gershom until his death in 1990.Although its circulation was never high when compared to the tabloids Maariv and Yedioth Ahronoth, it has for many years been regarded as the most influential intellectual newspaper in Israel with its readership including leading political and economic elites. It was considered a liberal newspaper although its economic section was conservative, and it published many outstanding feature articles.




After Gershom died, his son Amos assumed the role of chairman, CEO and publisher. In August 2006, 25% of the shares of Haaretz were sold to the German publisher M. DuMont Schauberg, whose father was a Nazi party member and whose publishing enterprises promoted Nazi ideology.Although he passionately denies being post-Zionist, Amos imposed his radical left-wing ideology onto the newspaper which has now been transformed into a vehicle that provides much of the anti-Israeli sentiment and even anti-Semitic lies and distortions that are a boon to our adversaries.It is difficult to comprehend the depths to which this once highly regarded newspaper has descended. There are still a number of level-headed commentators, such as Ari Shavit and Shlomo Avineri, and occasional “fig leaf” conservative columns contributed by Moshe Arens and Israel Harel. But the opinion section is overwhelmingly dominated by delusional anti-Zionists such as Gideon Levy and Amira Hass, who promote the idea that Israel was born in sin. Levy repeatedly reiterates that Israel is one of the world’s most brutal and tyrannical regimes in existence today and repeatedly accuses the Jewish state of being an apartheid state. Even publisher Schocken wrote a column titled “Only international pressure will end Israel apartheid.”These demonic views of their own country would be more appropriate for publication in the Palestinian media than in an Israeli newspaper.Furthermore, even the reporting became as opinionated as op-ed articles, frequently totally distorting news events and placing Israel in the worst possible light. The reporting has also become selective in its news coverage, a prime example being the suppressed coverage of then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s alleged corruption, in order not to create problems for the Gaza disengagement.If Haaretz was restricted to an Israeli audience, its impact would be minimal as it has a small circulation and few Israelis are influenced by what it publishes.The real problem is the English language edition and its internet site, which is monitored by diplomats and reproduced by the global media. It serves to demonize and delegitimize Israel to countless internet readers throughout the world who are under the illusion that they are reading a reputable liberal Israeli newspaper. Pro-Israel Diaspora activists who would normally have protested the bias and even the anti-Semitic slant of anti-Israeli media outlets, have been confronted by editors who defended their approach on the grounds that it reflected the editorial policies of a respected daily Israeli newspaper.The damage is incalculable. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that in recent years, the newspaper has caused more harm to the image of Israel than the combined efforts of our adversaries. Nothing demonstrates this more than the front-page headlines in 2009 based upon unsubstantiated evidence from the discredited Breaking the Silence group which first promoted the lie that Israeli soldiers were committing war crimes.After successive days in which Haaretz highlighted this blood libel, the IDF chief military advocate general released a report describing the accusations as “categorically false.” Instead of apologizing and expressing remorse, Haaretz responded sarcastically, suggesting that while the report showed the IDF to be “pure as snow,” implying that the accusers —fighters and commanders from some of its best combat units — were a bunch of liars and exaggerators.Despite the unequivocal repudiation of these false allegations, the damage was done. The global media enthusiastically highlighted the news from the “influential” Israeli newspaper. This paved the way for subsequent allegations of Israeli war crimes, culminating in the now discredited Goldstone report, which remains a central feature of the defamation leveled against us by our adversaries.In this context, it should be mentioned that the recently appointed editor of the English edition, Noa Landau, is the life partner of Avner Gvaryahu, one of the most vocal and vicious activist leaders of Breaking the Silence.Another notable example was the 2014 Haaretz Conference held in New York, where in deference to Palestinian Authority spokesman Saeb Erekat, who addressed the conference, the Israeli flag was removed from the podium.The situation has continued to deteriorate, with more readers canceling subscriptions, even including many prominent left-wing supporters who can no longer tolerate the ever increasing anti-Israel hysteria that fills the pages of the paper.Irit Linur, a liberal columnist for the weekend edition, wrote to Schocken, “I feel that the State of Israel fundamentally revolts you. … I don’t want to subscribe to a newspaper that tries in every way to make me ashamed of my Zionism, my patriotism and my intelligence — three qualities that are most precious to me.”Uzi Baram, also a respected leftist, wrote a column stating that even left-wing readers don’t want to read a newspaper “that is ashamed of its Zionism and which believes that without boycott from abroad, Israel has no chance of changing its position.”The harshest blow came from liberal American journalist icon Jeffrey Goldberg, who is regarded as the principal media source used by U.S. President Barack Obama in relation to Israel and Jewish affairs. Goldberg erupted after two American Jewish historians published an article in Haaretz accusing the U.N. of establishing a Jewish racist state that is today an extension of Western colonialism. They proudly announced that they would never set foot in any synagogue that supported Israel.Goldberg also responded to a recent Levy op-ed titled “Yes, Israel is an evil state” – which described Israel as an entity based on “pure evil. Sadistic evil. Evil for its own sake”. He announced that he was canceling his subscription, tweeting that “when neo-Nazis are emailing me links to Haaretz op-eds declaring Israel to be evil, I’m going to take a break.” He also noted that “I can read anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli things like this on other websites. There really no need for an Israeli website like this.”Sadly, Schocken’s delusional response was predictable. He expressed regret that the critics failed to recognize that, far from being a post-Zionist, he would not be deterred from ensuring that Haaretz maintained a Zionist program. Having had a lengthy personal discussion with Schocken on this theme, I can state with confidence that he is genuinely convinced that he is on the side of the angels and does not appreciate the immense harm that Haaretz’s anti-Israel demonization, delegitimization and political agenda have inflicted upon us abroad. Nor does he recognize the extent to which Haaretz has divorced itself from any semblance of political reality in terms of the nation.

<title>CANDIDLY SPEAKING: The ADL’s moral equivalence: Israelis and Palestinians</title>
<date>18/5/2016</date>
<content>
The Anti-Defamation League’s new national director, Jonathan Greenblatt,  previously a special assistant to US President Barack Obama, has begun to court  the liberal glitterati and their media by following the Obama lead and creating  daylight between the ADL and the Israeli government.In what was a coup  for J Street, the ADL chief last month became the first Jewish establishment  leader to address this essentially anti-Israeli organization, granting it  respectability and treating it as a legitimate extension of the Jewish  mainstream.




J Street, which had the financial backing of George Soros –  who loathes Israel – has the chutzpah to depict itself as “pro-Israel” but  claims an understanding superior to Israelis of what is best for them, declaring  its role as that of a parent obliged to impose “tough love” on drug-addicted  children.The hypocrisy of J Street’s repeated mantra of being  “pro-Israel” is illustrated in the following examples: • During Operation Cast  Lead, J Street accused Israel of an “escalation” that was “counterproductive”  and “disproportionate.” Finding difficulty in distinguishing “between who is  right and wrong” and in “picking a side,” J Street ascribed moral equivalency to  Israel and Hamas, and noted “that there are many who recognize elements of truth  on both sides of this gaping divide.”• J Street actively canvasses for  and raises millions of dollars to fund anti-Israeli congressional  candidates.• J Street collaborated with the biased and discredited UN  Goldstone commission, which accused Israel of war crimes, even facilitating  meetings on Capitol Hill for commission head Richard Goldstone. It also promoted  discredited anti-Israeli groups such as Breaking the Silence, which demonizes  the IDF.• J Street canvassed the White House not to veto a one-sided UN  Security Council resolution condemning Israel. It opposed the threat of force  and imposition of sanctions against Iran.• J Street has a history of  intemperate remarks about Israel. For example, it described the behavior of IDF  commandos boarding the Gaza flotilla’s Mavi Marmara ship as “cruel brutality”;  it defended US Secretary of State John Kerry’s observation that Israel could  become “an apartheid state”; and its co-founder, Daniel Levy, described Israel’s  creation as “an act gone wrong.”• J Street claims to oppose the  anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement but invites BDS groups to  participate in its conferences, providing them with platforms to promote their  hatred. J Street fervently calls for a boycott of all goods produced over the  Green Line.J Street is primarily supported by nominal Jews. Executive  director Jeremy Ben-Ami actually told The New York Times that his members mainly  comprised intermarried youngsters who attend “Buddhist Seders.”It has  basked in the support of the Obama administration and this year Vice President  Joe Biden addressed its convention – where he condemned Israel for not being  forthcoming in peace negotiations.In his speech to J Street, ADL’s  Greenblatt made appropriate remarks supporting Israel and condemning  anti-Semitism. But he also incorporated criticisms of Israel that were  thoroughly inappropriate, particularly with the upsurge of terrorism in Israel  and the international pressures it currently faces, and especially to a J Street  audience. He indirectly gave a seal of approval for the Obama administration to  impose solutions on future borders that could dramatically compromise Israel’s  security.Some of Greenblatt’s preposterous remarks: • In what was a  clear endorsement of Obama’s moral equivalence, he condemned “those who place  blame on one side instead of putting forward solutions that acknowledge the role  and responsibility of both sides.”For the head of the ADL to make such a  statement while the PA engages in incitement and Jews are murdered by  Palestinian fanatics is unconscionable. More so as all Israeli offers to reopen  direct negotiations have been spurned by the Palestinians.• Greenblatt  condemned fellow Jews for denying the rights of “marginalized Palestinians” and  failing to recognize the legitimacy of the “Palestinian narrative.”Is  the ADL director unaware that the Palestinian narrative refuses to recognize  Israel as a Jewish state, and claims that Israel was born in sin and that the  Jews stole the land from them? The Palestinians even deny Jewish connections to  the Holy Land and Jerusalem.Would Greenblatt have us consider this  narrative legitimate?• In his address, Greenblatt implicitly questioned  Israel’s democratic structure, stating, “We want to see Israel as a democratic  country that acknowledges and protects the rights of all its citizens, Ashkenazi  and Sephardic, sabra and immigrant, Jew and Arab.” Does Israel need to be told  by Greenblatt to “acknowledge and protect” its citizens? Is there any country in  the world that is more democratic and treats its minorities, including radical  Arabs parliamentarians, with greater equality?• Greenblatt embraced J Street as  a legitimate component of the Jewish mainstream, deploring the “shortcoming of  the Jewish establishment to allow for robust debate, to create a safe space for  all of us to talk, a big tent that respects the views of all parties. I believe  that a healthy dialogue is a Jewish value and see you as part of that dialogue  and I am standing before you today, bearing witness to that value.”The  negative impact of Greenblatt’s overtures to J Street should not be  underestimated. This is a crucial period in Israel-US relations. For one of the  wealthiest Jewish establishment bodies to shower praise on an organization with  a consistent track record of undermining and demonizing Israel and to call for  its inclusion in the “big tent” will surely serve to encourage Obama to exert  pressure against Israel in the last months of his tenure.It will signal  to the incoming president and Congress that the Jewish community is divided over  Israel and weaken the political influence of the American Israel Public Affairs  Committee and other organizations that support Israel.The reality is  that the vast majority of committed Jews are devoted to the welfare of Israel.  Many are supporters and funders of the ADL. They would be doing the ADL a favor  by making it clear to Greenblatt that he must concentrate on his mandate to  combat anti-Semitism and that if he intends to engage in friendly dialogue with  anti-Israeli bodies or assume a “neutral” role in relation to Israel, they will  withdraw support from the ADL.The writer’s website can be viewed at  www.wordfromjerusalem.com.

<title>Candidly Speaking: The tragedy of Ehud Olmert in retrospect</title>
<date>17/2/2016</date>
<content>
The image of former prime minister Ehud Olmert, now 70, entering Ma’asiyahu  Prison to serve a 19-month sentence for bribery and obstruction of justice is a  shocking stain on the entire nation.To witness such a talented man fall  to such depths saddened me.




I befriended Olmert after hosting him in  Australia in the 1980s, where he made a tremendous impact on the community and  built up a cadre of friends who admired him. Subsequently, I spent many hours  with him in the Knesset, in his ministerial offices, and was especially close to  him when he became mayor of Jerusalem.Olmert was a consummate politician  and fundraiser, an outstanding networker with an engaging personality and a  well-deserved reputation of loyalty to his friends. Ironically, following in his  father’s footsteps and being elected to the Knesset as the youngest MK, his  initial impact was a vigorous campaign against corruption.He opposed the  peace treaty with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat but subsequently mended his  fences with prime minister Menachem Begin and rose within the ranks of Likud,  serving a term as an exemplary health minister in the Shamir  government.Olmert was a leader in the national camp, bitterly opposed  the Oslo Accords, sought to close Orient House, the PLO ’s headquarters in  Jerusalem, and even demanded the right of Jews to pray on the Temple  Mount.In 1993, he was elected mayor of Jerusalem, defeating the  longstanding and legendary Teddy Kolleck.For 10 years as mayor he was a  champion for a united Jerusalem. When prime minister Ehud Barak floated the idea  of dividing the capital in an unsuccessful effort to coax Yasser Arafat to agree  to a settlement, Olmert organized a massive global meeting in support of a  united Jerusalem, attended by 300,000 people.In 2003, Olmert reentered  the Knesset as a member of Sharon’s government, serving for three years as  minister of industry, trade and labor. In a shocking display of crude political  opportunism, the rightwing Likud leader with a Revisionist background became,  virtually overnight, prime minister Sharon’s most aggressive and effective  proponent of the disastrous unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip. He was  brutal and even cruel in the mocking of his former friends and allies and  trivialized the forcible eviction of the Gush Katif settlements. At that stage,  I became one of his most fervent critics.Olmert’s volte-face was  reflected in a keynote speech he gave to the left-wing American-based Israel  Policy Forum in June 2005, when he stated, “We are tired of fighting, we are  tired of being courageous, we are tired of winning, we are tired of defeating  our enemies.”Having secured for himself the title of deputy prime  minister, he was able to seize the reins of leadership when Sharon was  incapacitated by a stroke.In July 2006, Olmert led the nation into the  disastrous Second Lebanon War. In response to public outrage over the conduct of  the war, Olmert himself handpicked a commission of inquiry, headed by retired  judge Eliyahu Winograd, which nevertheless produced a scathing report,  condemning the zigzagging policies that prevailed during the 34 days of the war  and culminated in “a major and grave missed opportunity” to inflict a major  defeat of Hezbollah and restore Israel’s deterrence. The report employed the  term “failure” 190 times and “flaws” 213 times.Following the publication  of the report, polls indicated that 80 percent of Israelis felt Olmert should  resign immediately. But he made a mockery of any form of accountability,  contemptuously dismissing the report and public opposition, and even had the  chutzpah to claim that the findings had exonerated and “lifted the moral stigma”  from him.In 2007, Olmert participated in the revived peace talks in  Annapolis, Maryland, where he virtually adopted the Palestinian narrative,  stating that “for dozens of years, many Palestinians have been living in camps,  disconnected from the environment in which they grew, wallowing in poverty,  neglect, alienation, bitterness and a deep, unrelenting sense of deprivation.  ...I know that this pain and humiliation are the deepest foundations which  fomented the hatred against us.” Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas  ignored Olmert’s groveling remarks, stressing that the Palestinians would never  recognize Israel as a Jewish state.Olmert told the Israeli media that  unless a Palestinian state were created, the Jewish state would be engaged in  apartheid and “the State of Israel is finished.”Desperate to  rehabilitate his political reputation and retrieve his legacy – and without  consulting the Knesset or cabinet – Olmert offered Abbas 98% of the West Bank,  forgoing defensible borders and Israel’s security presence along the Jordan  River.Furthermore, he agreed to divide Jerusalem and was even willing to  yield jurisdiction of the Temple Mount to a multinational committee. He also  undertook to allow a number of Arab refugees to settle inside Israel without any  reference to restitution for Jews expelled from Arab countries in  1948.Fortunately for Israel, like his predecessor Arafat, Abbas rejected  Olmert’s proposals and even failed to make a counter offer, merely repeating his  demand of the “right of return” for all Palestinian refugees, which amounts to  the dissolution of the Jewish state.In retrospect, Olmert proved to be  the worst prime minister Israel has known. The irresponsible unauthorized offers  he extended to the Palestinians are to this day being exploited by them as a  benchmark for reopening negotiations.Like many politicians, Olmert  absorbed the hedonistic environment in which he circulated. Being in a position  of power with the absence of adequate checks and balances, he became engaged in  questionable and corrupt deals. This led to allegations of corruption and  ultimately, in September 2008, Olmert was forced by defense minister Ehud Barak  and foreign minister Tzipi Livni to relinquish his prime ministerial role,  though he remained in office until Benjamin Netanyahu took over in March  2009.The initial verdict of the Jerusalem District Court, prior to the  “Holyland” trial, while highly critical of his conduct and finding him guilty of  a breach of trust – a criminal offense – did not impose a prison sentence. At  the time, I wrote a column titled “Olmert: Count your blessings and retire  graciously.”Unfortunately Olmert went on a triumphalist rampage,  insisting (incorrectly) that he had been fully exonerated, and proclaimed that  he would soon resume his role as prime minister. He embarked on a global  campaign to discredit the Netanyahu government and identified himself with  far-leftists, even giving the keynote address to J Street.His subsequent  trials, which culminated in his conviction and a six-year sentence reduced to 19  months – which pending another case still to be determined could be extended to  27 months – represent a shameful reflection of the abysmally low level of  personal morality to which some Israeli politicians have descended. Sadly,  Olmert follows in the footsteps of a former president convicted of rape, an  interior minister of bribery, a finance minister of embezzlement and social  welfare minister of bribery. On the positive side, at least it demonstrates that  in Israel, nobody is above the rule of law.Without diminishing his moral  corruption, my feeling is that Olmert’s devastating role in the Second Lebanon  War and his groveling to the Palestinians will have a far greater negative  long-term impact on Israel than the activities for which he was sentenced to  jail.Having said that, I am saddened and will nostalgically relate to  the Ehud Olmert I knew before he betrayed his ideals – a man who did good things  for the Jewish people before being possessed by a dybbuk.The writer’s  website can be viewed at www.wordfromjerusalem.com.

<title>Center Field: Celebrate Martin Luther King Day by saying Gaza isn't Ferguson</title>
<date>12/1/2016</date>
<content>
Over the next week, many American Jews will celebrate Martin Luther King’s birthday at their synagogues, in community centers, or in African-American churches. Most American Jews, from Left to Right, embrace King’s message of racial equality, personal dignity, constitutional justice and aspirational democracy.I am making a personal plea to every rabbi, every community leader, every citizen, Jewish or non-Jewish, black or white, Left or Right, to take this opportunity to refute the growing libels spreading among many black Americans against Israel and the Jewish people.




Please work into your Martin Luther King Day speeches, prayers and private conversations three essential messages: Gaza is not Ferguson; Zionism is not racism nor is Israel an apartheid state.Moreover, a healthy, mutually-respectful alliance is essential to both blacks and Jews.Popularizing their latest lie, Palestinian activists are trying to link “occupation” from “Ferguson to Gaza.” This is a cheap, dishonest attempt to build solidarity among “people of color,” even though some Palestinians are white and some Israelis are black. This insulting oversimplification threatens to divide blacks and Jews.Gaza isn’t Ferguson because: • America’s divide is biological, racial, not the national clash of Israelis versus Palestinians.• America’s racial story begins with slavery and black powerlessness, while Palestinians have shaped their national story at key moments. Palestinians chose not to accept the 1947 partition, to ignore Ehud Barak’s Camp David 2000 compromise and dismiss Ehud Olmert’s 2008 concessions.• The African-American story stars non-violent peacemakers like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Barack Obama, while the Palestinian story features violent demagogues and terrorists like Haj Amin al-Husseini and Yasser Arafat.• No mainstream African-American organization seeks America’s destruction, whereas the Hamas charter echoes the PLO charter’s longstanding call for Israel’s destruction.• No systematic African-American violence or terrorist group targets whites, while many Palestinian terrorist groups hunt down Jews, not just Israelis.• And Gaza isn’t Ferguson, because Gaza, since Israel’s disengagement, is a Jew-free Palestinian zone, run by Hamas, which dictates Gazans’ destiny. Ferguson is an integrated American city where blacks and whites live together – usually harmoniously.This new “Big Black Lie” updates what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called the Soviet-Palestinian “Big Red Lie,” that Zionism is a form of racism, including the contemptible UN attempt in 1975 to compare Israel to South Africa and Nazi Germany.When African-American activists echo this simplistic anti-Zionist sloganeering, they trash Martin Luther King’s legacy, because King recognized the anti-Semitism behind anti-Zionism. King respected Jewish national rights and Palestinian national rights. He sought reconciliation.When African-American activists insult Israel and the Jewish people they open historic wounds. Just as African- Americans are justifiably sensitive to slights because of their traumatic past, Jews are justifiably sensitive too.The messianic dream of Theodor Herzl, Zionism’s founder, included saving African blacks after saving the Jews, because “only a Jew can fathom” African slavery, in all its “horror.”Even if no one monopolizes empathy, it’s important to toast the deep ties between Jews and blacks. The American connection is most familiar, with the many examples of Jews supporting the Civil Rights movement, from Rabbi Dick Hirsch and the Reform movement offering King office space in Washington, DC, to the shared Jewish and African- American blood spilled in Mississippi when Klansmen murdered Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Earl Chaney.This relationship has been healthy, mutual, not a one-way street. Beyond King’s support for Israel and Zionism, when the UN labeled Zionism racism, even the former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver declared himself “shocked” because “the Jews have not only suffered particularly from racist persecution, they have done more than any other people to expose and condemn racism.”While sympathizing with the Palestinian “search for justice,” Cleaver could “see no net gain for freedom and human dignity in the world” from these “UN resolutions repugnant to human reason and historical fact.”Meanwhile, as Zionists and black activists bonded in New York, Israelis and blacks bonded in Africa. Israel’s Mashav initiative for developing countries has worked to help modernize Africa since the 1950s. Mashav has trained over 200,000 international aid workers and assisted people in 140 countries, with a particular concentration – and impressive track record – in Black Africa.Finally, appealing to the head as well as the heart, every Martin Luther King Day speaker should make a two-pronged argument to our African-American activist friends about their potential role in the Middle East conflict. They can continue playing the role too many play in universities today, joining the anti-Zionist pileon against Israel and Jews on campuses, committing macro-aggressions against Jews in an age when the smallest triggering micro-aggressions are not tolerated.They can continue sending Jews into our own trauma vortex and guaranteeing no compromise, no flexibility over the Middle East conflict, which is the natural tendency when attacked.Alternatively, using their historic ties with the Jewish people, building on their recent affinities with Palestinians, isn’t it time for African-Americans in the King and Cleaver tradition to try mediating, reconciling. Rather than exacerbating the problem, joining one side while risking radicalizing the other through discrimination and hostility, African-Americans have unique standing as mediators. As bridge-builders, they could deploy their credibility with both sides to seek a compromise, which will require mutual recognition of each side’s legitimacy, each side’s pain, and each side’s willingness to compromise a lot but gain even more – a chance at peace.And so, this Martin Luther King Day, hijack the ecumenical festivities, not to score points for “our” side but to stop the bleeding; not to grandstand but to bridge-build; not to add tension but to push for reconciliation, helping to heal all three peoples’ wounds.

Change of underwear Your July 31 front-page story “Cabinet to vote on portfolio  reshuffle today” caught my attention – and expectation that we were to be  treated to a much-needed revitalization.




However, on reading the details,  I was reminded of a wartime joke.The Red Cross insisted that prisoners  of war be allowed to change underwear. The commandant of the prison camp agreed  and bellowed to the prisoners: “Barracks 1 will change underwear with Barracks  2.”ALAN (SHLOMO) KOOR
Petah TikvaFaulty comparisonWhile most of  “Cracking down on the hilltop youth” (Comment, July 31) is acceptable, one line  made me really angry. While discussing the philosophy of some of the hilltop  youth, Yossi Melman states: “In a way, they are a Jewish version of  ISIS.”What in the world was Melman thinking? Do these kids go around  beheading “infidels”? They might want Israel to be all Jewish, but they do not  say “kill all others” or “let’s expand to the whole world!” Islamic State wants  a caliphate, where everyone follows its particular brand of Islam or is labeled  a non-believer and is liable to be put to death. It wants to take over Europe  and the US, and is slowly making inroads.The hilltop youth might want to  eradicate avoda zara (foreign, or non-Jewish labor) from the land – and  unfortunately some have acted – but how does this compare to the widespread  destruction of ancient archeological and tourist sites by ISIS? Also, ISIS does  not treat women well, in an understatement. Not so these Jewish  boys.These teens unfortunately can be violent, reaching an extreme level  at Duma, but are in absolutely no way to be mentioned in the same breath as  ISIS.BATYA BERLINGER 
JerusalemI sit shocked while reading and rereading  Yossi Melman’s “Cracking down on the hilltop youth.” He makes a statement that  is despicable: “In a way they are a Jewish version of ISIS.”Mr. Melman,  please show evidence of rapings, beheadings, mass murder, throwing gay men off  rooftops, women executed for not being dressed modestly and of any time the  hilltop youth wrapped the necks of Arabs in explosives and detonated them. Until  then, please cease and desist from this vile, twisted and disgusting  descriptive.Shame on you, and shame on The Jerusalem Post for allowing  such acidic bile to be printed in the paper.

Spider in the web 

Whether you realize it or not, “Carmi: Silent boycotts  a worrisome phenomenon” (July 31) was a cynical and calculated attempt to  obscure the fact that Ben-Gurion University of the Negev president Rivka Carmi  is a spider in the web of anti-Zionism and BDS, which constitutes virtually the  entire Faculty of Social Sciences at the university.For years, Carmi has  stated that the problem didn’t exist or it was only one or two faculty members,  whereas now, even she has to admit that it is 50-60. The truth is that during  her period in office, these people have been recruited, promoted, financed,  given tenure and sent abroad to spread their poisonous, self-hating anti-Zionism  throughout the world.It is laughable to suggest that Carmi wants to  encourage people to come and see Israel for what it is when she knows perfectly  well that in the classrooms they will hear that Israel is an illegitimate state  that has colonized other people’s lands and practices apartheid.When an  independent, international committee of the Council of Higher Education  condemned the BGU faculty in terms of quality, curriculum and academic  integrity, Carmi promised to make changes – none of which were  honored.It is time to put someone in charge of the university that bears  the name of David Ben-Gurion who honors, rather than undermines, his legacy and  reintroduces a credible system of corporate governance at BGU and other  institutes of higher learning in Israel.MICHAEL GROSS

The writer is a member of the Board of Governors of BGU.Confusing  terminologyRegarding “The long war on terror” (“Comment & Features, July  31), David Rieff writes: “Even assuming that the Islamic State can be  defeated... the group’s efforts to inspire people... to carry out attacks on  their own are likely to continue to resonate.”Islamic State can inspire  people to carry out attacks on “infidels” because such people have already been  indoctrinated in Islamic schools and mosques to be violent. If we fail to  address this problem, Rieff is right that we will have to endure continuing  attacks.Yet I am confused by his terminology.He refers to a  “political elite” that denies any rational fear of Islamism, and to political  demagogues who promote parties of fear. Perhaps they are not demagogues, but  prophets, and the parties are of sanity, not fear? PHILIP BRIEFF Jerusalem Core  curriculum Reading about haredi parents who have finally found the courage to  fight the insane haredi establishment’s stand on secular studies (“Haredi  parents initiate petition demanding core curriculum,” July 29) was a breath of  fresh air. Finally, we hear the voice of religious Jews who have never belittled  knowledge and education declaring openly that core curriculum studies should be  included in all Jewish school systems.I can only say these words: Thank  you and best wishes!

Jerusalem Rio Olympics

Kudos to The  Jerusalem Post for the excellent Rio Olympics supplement (July 29).It is  great to see that a large Israeli contingent will participate in spite of all  the bad press regarding conditions, security, crime and, of course, the Zika  virus. Israel is also providing a great deal of the hi-tech needed for the  smooth running of the Games.We wish the competitors the best of luck and  success. Let the Games begin! SALLY SHAW Kfar Saba Reading The Jerusalem Post  about the concerns regarding the Rio Olympics, I’m becoming more optimistic  about the conditions.On July 28, we read “The four most pressing  concerns with the Olympics in Brazil” (Sports). On July 31, we read, also in the  Sports section, “The three biggest threats to Rio Olympics.”The good  news is that you eliminated the Zika virus as a major concern. I’m sure that, as  per the data in your May 29 supplement, the athletes will be protecting  themselves from mosquito bites.I hope that by Friday night, when the  Games open, the security, transportation/traffic and water concerns will have  been overcome, or at least greatly reduced, and that after the Olympics are  over, the games will not be remembered alongside the 1972 Munich Olympics or the  1997 Maccabiah, where the bridge over the polluted Yarkon River  collapsed.God should protect all the visitors and participants at this  year’s Olympics. May they enjoy a carnival in a city considered by many to be  one of the most beautiful world, even with its problems.ELHANAN  DIESENDRUCK
Netanya Spurious allegationsAnti-Semitism is alive and well, and  living in Germany. I refer to your article about a university in Germany  attacking Israel’s right to exist (“German university course claims Israel  harvesting Palestinian organs,” July 25).It would be useful for the  university to subject its faculty to a refresher course in ethics and morality,  with a focus on verification of facts prior to dissemination of such spurious  allegations.
Once again, Jew-hatred is veiled in anti-Israel  propaganda.

<title>Column One: Coordinated assault</title>
<date>21/1/2016</date>
<content>
‘I’m proud of him.”That’s what the father of Dafna Meir’s murderer said  when the Palestinian media asked him what he thinks of his cold-blooded son  Murad Adais.




On Sunday afternoon, Adais butchered Meir in her home, in  front of her children.Whether Adais Sr. is really happy that his son  will rot in prison is less important than the fact that he said what he said to  his home crowd.He knows that his audience thinks his son is a hero. And  so he played to his audience.Since last September when the Palestinians  began their current terrorist onslaught, killers like Adais have been  characterized as lone wolves. But a study published last November in Mosaic  online journal by Shalem College’s Daniel Polisar shows that this  characterization is both wrong and unhelpful.Polisar studied Palestinian  public opinion data from surveys conducted by four independent research groups  over the past 25 years. His data exposed three key aspects to Palestinian  positions about Israel that all bear directly on the current Palestinian  terrorist offensive.His first finding is that throughout most of the  past quarter-century a solid majority of Palestinians have supported terrorism  against Israelis.Moreover, the more murderous an attack, the more it is  supported.Polisar’s second finding was that the vast majority of  Palestinians hate Israelis and believe that Jews have no right to the Land of  Israel, and therefore our state has no right to exist.Taken together,  these first two insights lead to one clear conclusion about the nature of the  current Palestinian terrorism campaign against Israelis. As Polisar explained,  they show that this campaign is not being carried out by “lone wolves,” who have  been incited by Palestinian Authority propaganda. Rather, that propaganda  reflects the murderous hatred that the vast majority of Palestinians feel toward  Israelis and Israel.Adais and his comrades may or may not be members of  terrorist groups. But they are the loyal representatives of their  terrorism-supporting society.Obviously, any talk of a peace process in  this climate is utter folly. The most Israel can aspire to is to deter the  hate-soaked Palestinians from attacking us.This brings us to the third  insight of Polisar’s study. Twenty-five years of survey data make clear that  most Palestinians believe that terrorism pays.And the plain fact is that  they are right. For the past generation, the Palestinians have only benefited  from killing Israelis through terrorism.The fact that Israeli  concessions to the Palestinians have strengthened their conviction that  terrorism pays rather than convinced them to make peace shows that all  concessions in the face of terrorism are dangerous.While the majority of  Israelis have learned this lesson and so elected governments that oppose  appeasement, the Palestinians have learned that the Israeli public does not have  the final word on whether or not they will be rewarded for their crimes against  humanity.The Palestinians believe that Israel is dependent on Western  goodwill. So to the extent that the West pressures Israel surrender to  Palestinian demands, the US and the EU work hand in glove with Palestinian  terrorists and prove that they are right to murder mothers in their homes in  front of their children.This week US Ambassador Dan Shapiro proved the  Palestinians right, yet again.At the outset of his speech before the  Institute of National Security Studies on Monday, Shapiro issued a pro forma  condemnation of “barbaric acts of terrorism” against Israelis at the outset of  his remarks.But that was just clearing his throat. In his substantive  remarks, Shapiro accused Israel of institutional racism in Judea and  Samaria.Shapiro’s slanderous accusation channeled and escalated his boss  Secretary of State John Kerry’s anti-Israel libel from two years ago. In early  2014, Kerry alleged that if Israel didn’t cough up Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem  soon, it risked becoming a criminal apartheid state in the future.By  falsely alleging that Israel uses one (lenient) law against Israelis and another  (iron fisted) law against Palestinians, Shapiro gave substance to Kerry’s  two-year-old assault. And in claiming that this state of affairs exists today,  he transformed Kerry’s incendiary claim of an apartheid future into a defamatory  rap sheet for current imaginary offenses.The timing of Shapiro’s blood  libel was significant for two reasons. First, the day after a Palestinian  murdered Meir, and hours after another Palestinian stabbed another Jewish mother  in the late stages of pregnancy, the US ambassador told the Palestinians that  America blames Israel for their barbarism.Shapiro maligned Israel just  as the Council of Europe announced it was firming up its rules for labeling  Jewish-made products from Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem and published a document  on its plans for handling a unicorn called “the Middle East Peace  Process.”Both the EU’s announcement about labeling Jewish products and  its document about the nonexistent “Middle East Peace Process” were notable for  two reasons. First, they made no mention whatsoever of terrorism. As far as the  Europeans are concerned, the only side preventing peace is Israel. And to bring  peace, the EU calls for the Jewish state to be treated like Jews in Europe –  that is, singled out for discrimination, abuse and insults.The near  simultaneity of Shapiro’s slander and the EU’s latest discriminatory steps  against Israel tells the Palestinians that they should keep up their attacks.  Israel will be hard pressed to launch an effective counterattack with the  Americans and Europeans breathing down its neck demanding  concessions.The message these statements communicate to Israel is  actually worse than that. The simultaneity of these remarks was not  coincidental.Neither was State Department spokesman James Kirby’s  condemnation of Israel’s lawful land policies in the Jordan Valley, which was  followed immediately by a similar condemnation by UN Secretary-General Ban  Ki-moon and a call by the PA for a UN Security Council resolution against  Israel. Taken together they show that we are in the midst of a coordinated  US-led political offensive against Israel.How is Israel supposed to  defend itself against this coordinated terrorist-diplomatic onslaught? How can  Israel keep the Americans and Europeans at bay and deter the Palestinians from  murdering its citizens? Beyond the counterterror measures that are already being  carried out, Israel needs to act on three levels.On the diplomatic  front, the government needs to change the focus of its public  diplomacy.The government currently accepts the false claim that the  Palestinian terrorist onslaught is being carried out by lone wolves. Its public  diplomacy is limited as a consequence to condemning official Palestinian  Authority incitement.This line is wrong and counterproductive.It  lends credence to the false conclusion that the assault is limited and can  therefore be overlooked by Westerners eager to attack Israel.In their  public pronouncements, our officials should direct their remarks against  Palestinian society as a whole. So too the government should attack the radical  Left in Israel and in the West that supports a society that seeks to annihilate  Israel, applauds barbarism and kills anyone who wishes to live at peace with  Israel.Wednesday, a storm erupted in England following The Sun’s  publication of the findings of an undercover investigation of so-called human  rights groups broadcast on Channel 2’s investigative news magazine two weeks  ago. That investigation showed senior “human rights” activists Ezra Nawi from  Ta’ayush and Nasser Nawaja from B’Tselem plotting to turn over to the  Palestinian security forces a Palestinian who wished to sell land to Jews.  Nawajah and Nawi acted with the full knowledge that he would be tortured and  killed. In a heated debate in the British Parliament, lawmakers demanded to know  why the government was funding B’Tselem with taxpayer funds. In other words, the  lawmakers showed that a policy of exposing the barbarism of Palestinian society  and the fanaticism of its Western supporters is effective.The second  area where the government must act is in its settlement policies. Although it  will be difficult for Israel to face down the Obama administration and respect  Jewish property rights in Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem in the coming year,  nothing is stopping it from destroying illegal EU-financed Palestinian  construction in Area C.The government should act forcefully to remove  all of the EU-constructed illegal Palestinian settlements in Area C of Judea and  Samaria. The place the government should begin demolition is at the illegal  Palestinian settlement outside the national heritage site of Sussiya, just  kilometers from where Dafna Meir was murdered. The dual purpose of that specific  EU-financed illegal building project is to threaten the Israeli communities of  Sussiya and Mitzpe Yair and to deny the historic significance of the ancient  Jewish city of Sussiya.Destroying the squatter community will send a  potent message to the Palestinians and their Western abettors.At the  same time, the government should speed up the pace of building new Israeli  communities across the armistice line from Sussiya in the northern Negev around  Arad in state lands being threatened by the EU-supported Beduin who are working  in coordination with the Palestinian squatters in the South Hebron  Hills.The final thing that Israel needs to do in the face of the  Palestinian terrorism supported by Western political warfare is to rub the EU  bureaucrats’ faces in the fact that Israel is succeeding where their governments  are failing. It isn’t enough for Israel to call for the Jews of France and the  rest of Western Europe to make aliya. Over the past two years, aliya from  Western Europe has reached all-time highs. As the governments that single out  the Jewish state for abuse prove on a daily basis that they cannot protect their  Jewish citizens, more and more European Jews are heeding the call and moving to  Israel.But over the past several months, it has become apparent that for  all our goodwill, Israel has not figured out how to absorb its newest citizens.  Dentists, pharmacists and other professionals are chewed up and spit out by a  bureaucracy of professional guilds whose protectionist licensing requirements  are convincing many people to turn around and go back to Europe. The government  must make it an urgent priority to break the guilds. It is far more important to  enable Jewish professionals from France to work in their fields in Israel than  to protect the antiquated licensing requirements of hidebound professional  cliques.Israel is under a coordinated assault by the Palestinians who  hate us and the Europeans and Americans who are hostile to us.Our  options for dealing with this assault are not optimal. But they are formidable.  If we make judicious use of them, we can flummox the White House and the EU, and  at a minimum, we can begin to prove to the Palestinians that their faith in  terrorism is no longer justified.

<title>Column One: The ADL’s new bedfellows</title>
<date>24/11/2016</date>
<content>
In an interview this week with the Australian media, Jordan’s King Abdullah  became the latest Arab leader to express hope that President- elect Donald Trump  and his team will lead the world’s to date failed fight against jihadist  Islam.Like his counterparts in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Abdullah  effectively ruled out the possibility that President Barack Obama will take any  constructive steps to defeat the forces of global jihad in his last months in  power. Speaking of the humanitarian disaster in Aleppo for instance, Abdullah  said, “I don’t think there’s much we can do until the new administration is in  place and a strategy is formulated.”




Egyptian President Abdel Fatah  al-Sisi was among the first Arab leaders to welcome Trump’s victory.Sisi  has been largely shunned by the Obama administration.President Barack  Obama supported the Muslim Brotherhood regime that Sisi and the Egyptian  military overthrew in 2013.Sisi was the first foreign leader to speak to  Trump after his victory was announced. He released a statement to the media  saying that he “looks forward to the presidency of president Donald Trump to  inject a new spirit into the trajectory of Egyptian-American  relations.”The support that the incoming Trump administration is  garnering in the Arab world stands in stark contrast to the near wall-to-wall  opposition to Trump expressed by the American Muslim community.According  to a survey of Muslim American opinion taken in October by the Council for  American Islamic Relations (CAIR), 72% of American Muslims supported Democratic  nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump was supported by a mere 4% of the Muslim  community.Muslim American activists played key roles in the Clinton  campaign. They were particularly active in swing states like Ohio and Michigan  where Trump won by narrow margins.As The Jerusalem Post reported  Wednesday, since the election, Muslim American leaders have expressed concern  and hostility toward the incoming Trump administration. Muslim Democrat activist  James Zogby, who also heads the Arab American Institute, published an op-ed in  The Jordan Times to this effect after the election. Zogby expressed concern that  the Trump administration would harm the civil rights of Arab  Americans.The gap between the Arab world’s support for Trump and the  Muslim American community’s opposition to him is particularly notable because it  reverberates strongly the growing cleavage between the Israeli government and  public and large swaths of the American Jewish community.Led most  prominently by the Anti-Defamation League and its executive director Jonathan  Greenblatt, in the wake of the election, American Jews are at the forefront of  efforts to delegitimize Trump and his senior advisers. Unlike their Muslim  American counterparts, who are keeping their criticism of Arab regimes to  themselves, Greenblatt, the ADL and their allies on the Left have linked their  opposition to Trump to legitimizing opponents of Israel.Before assuming  his role at the ADL, Greenblatt worked in Valerie Jarrett’s political influence  shop in the Obama White House. As ADL chief, Greenblatt has used his position as  the head of a major Jewish organization to support the Obama administration’s  policies. To this end, since the election, the ADL has worked to tar the  incoming Trump administration as antisemitic, focusing its fire on Trump’s  senior strategist, former Breitbart News CEO Stephen Bannon.The ADL  spearheaded the campaign to label Bannon an antisemite. When its claims were  shown to be entirely spurious, this week the ADL quietly acknowledged that  Bannon has actually never made any antisemitic statements. But its quiet  admission of spreading lies didn’t stop the ADL from continuing to traffic in  them. Even after it admitted that “we are not aware of any antisemitic  statements from Bannon,” the ADL continued to insist that Breitbart has been a  home for antisemites because some Jew-haters wrote antisemitic responses to  Breitbart articles.The ADL’s smear campaign against Bannon is a  hard-sell because Breitbart is among the most pro-Israel websites in the US. But  this brings us to the second aspect of the ADL-led campaign against  President-elect Donald Trump and his team.With each passing day, it  becomes increasingly clear that the ADL and its allies are using the Trump  victory as a means to draw a distinction between pro-Israel and Jew-friendly  while arguing that antisemites support Israel and that people who hate Israel  are not antisemites. This was the clear goal at the ADL’s summit on antisemitism  last week.As Daniel Greenfield reported Thursday in Front- Page  Magazine, the ADL used the conference to legitimize the so-called BDS campaign  to boycott Jewish Israeli products and divest from businesses that do business  with Jewish-owned Israeli businesses.It similarly normalized the general  argument that there is nothing inherently antisemitic about opposing the Jewish  state.In a panel with the disturbing title, “Is Delegitimization of  Israel Antisemitism?” the ADL featured anti-Israel activists Jill Jacobs and  Jane Eisen. Both women argued that BDS is legitimate. At the same time, they  denounced fervent supporters of Israel like Bannon and Center for Security  President Frank Gaffney.Greenfield reported that the ADL gave a  prominent platform at the conference supposedly dedicated to fighting  antisemitism to Ford Foundation CEO Darren Walker. The Ford Foundation is one of  the leading contributors to anti-Israel organizations in the US and to  anti-Zionist political front groups in Israel.Other speakers explained  that it isn’t that Israel’s foes are antisemitic. It is just that Israelis and  their supporters have become “hypersensitive” to criticism.All in all,  Greenfield concluded, “Instead of tackling antisemitism, the ADL was tackling  Israel and pro-Israel Jews” and “normalizing anti-Israel rhetoric and  organizations.”A few days after the conference, the ADL took the next  step toward normalizing hatred for Israel in America when it announced its  support for Rep.Keith Ellison’s candidacy to serve as the next chairman  of the Democratic National Committee.Ellison became the first Muslim  American elected to the House of Representatives in 2006. In the decades that  preceded his election, Ellison built a long and documented history of membership  in and advocacy and employment for the antisemitic Nation of Islam. In his  capacity as a Nation of Islam spokesman, Ellison made antisemitic statements and  promoted anti-Jewish and anti-Israel positions and activists.Since  joining the House of Representatives, Ellison has been one of the leading  anti-Israel voices in Congress. He has spearheaded multiple anti-Israel  initiatives. He openly supports the boycott of Israeli Jewish products and has  castigated Israel as an apartheid state.Together with James Zogby, last  August Ellison served as a member of the Democratic Party’s platform committee.  The men attempted to purge the platform of language in support of  Israel.Yet Wednesday the ADL released a statement extolling Ellison as  “a man of good character.” The ADL praised him as “an ally in the fight against  antisemitism and for civil rights.”It even said that Ellison “has been  on record in support of Israel.”ADL is supporting Ellison – and opposing  Trump and his pro-Israel advisers – because Greenblatt and his backers support  Obama’s policies in the Middle East and want to make it difficult for Trump to  abandon them.Ellison and the leading American Muslim groups oppose Trump  for the same reason. The difference between the two groups is that the ADL and  its Jewish backers are acting in this manner because they support the Left,  which Obama leads. Ellison and his allies at CAIR, the Islamic Society of North  America, and the Arab American Institute and other groups oppose Trump because  they support the substance of Obama’s policies.The chief characteristics  of Obama’s Middle East policies have been support for the Muslim Brotherhood and  Iran against Israel and the US’s Sunni allies.Former FBI agent and  counterterrorism expert John Guandolo estimates that upward of 80% of Islamic  centers and mosques in the US are controlled by the Muslim  Brotherhood.The major American Muslim groups, including CAIR, ISNA and  the Islamic Circle of North America are tied to the Muslim Brotherhood. The  Muslim Brotherhood in turn supports Iran.During his year in power in  Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi permitted Iranian warships to  travel through the Suez Canal, hosted Iranian leaders and Hezbollah commanders  in Cairo and took a series of additional steps to embrace Iran.Trump’s  foreign policy adviser Walid Phares gave an interview to Egyptian television  after Trump’s election stating that Trump will support a bill introduced by Sen.  Ted Cruz to outlaw the Muslim Brotherhood in the US as well as its offshoots  CAIR, ISNA and others due to their support for jihadist terrorist groups formed  by Brotherhood members. Al-Qaida, Hamas and a host of other jihadist groups have  all been formed by Muslim Brotherhood followers.Trump’s national  security adviser, Lt.-Gen. (ret.) Mike Flynn; Rep. Mike Pompeo, whom Trump has  selected to serve as his CIA director; as well as Marine Gen. James Mattis, the  leading contender to serve as Trump’s defense secretary are all outspoken  opponents of Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran.Given the stakes, then, it  makes perfect sense that the Arab American groups oppose Trump.It also  makes sense that Arab regimes threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran  support Trump and eagerly await his inauguration.And it clearly makes  sense for Israel to welcome Trump’s election.The only thing that makes  no sense is the American Jewish campaign to demonize Trump. The ADL’s leadership  of the campaign to smear Trump and his advisers while legitimizing BDS and  supporting Israel-bashers is antithetical to the interests of the American  Jewish community.In adopting these positions, Greenblatt and the ADL  along with their allies in J Street, Jewish Voices for Peace, If Not Now, The  Forward, other far-left groups and mainstream groups that have lost their way  show through their actions that they have conflated their Judaism with their  support for the Left.To the extent that the interests of the Jews of  America contradict the positions of the Left, the Jews of America are behaving  in an “antisemitic” way.It is the responsibility of the segment of the  community that understands “Jewish” is not a synonym of “leftist” to oppose the  ADL and its backers. If they fail to do so, they will contribute to the descent  of the community into powerlessness and irrelevance, not only in the era of  Trump, but into the future.

<title>Column One: The consequences of anti-Zionism</title>
<date>24/3/2016</date>
<content>
What do radical Israeli groups have in common with their European funders?Last Thursday, Channel 2 broadcast candid camera footage of Breaking the Silence members gathering classified information on IDF operations. The footage was taken by Ad Kan activists.




Breaking the Silence claims to be an organization dedicated to collecting testimonies from IDF soldiers documenting ill-treatment of Palestinians. Posing as soldiers with information to share, Ad Kan activists were interrogated by Breaking the Silence investigators.Yet rather than question them about how their units treated Palestinians, Breaking the Silence members asked them about troop movements, weapons platforms, IDF cooperation with foreign militaries. The investigators asked what sort of guns an unmanned combat vehicle carried, who controlled the vehicle and whether it was in operational use.They wanted to know how the IDF discovers Hamas tunnels. They wanted to know when tanks were used in battles and how.Breaking the Silence’s intelligence operations didn’t stop with post-operational debriefs.A Breaking the Silence employee named Frima Bobis is filmed telling Ad Kan activists how when she was still in high school, a Breaking the Silence worker advised her where to serve during her military service.She followed his advice, served in the civil administration’s office in Nablus, and upon her discharge, was able to give Breaking the Silence useful information.Breaking the Silence hired her shortly after her return to civilian life.Julia Novak, Breaking the Silence’s executive director, did not dispute Ad Kan’s findings. In her response to the broadcast she gave three defenses for her group’s activities.First, she said, Ad Kan’s findings are unworthy of attention because it is a “settler” organization.Second, she said that her group’s noble goal of “ending the occupation” gives it the right to collect and hold classified information. In other words, just as Ad Kan’s support for Israeli control over Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem makes it illegitimate, so Breaking the Silence’s support for ending “the occupation” renders it immune from criticism.These claims ring familiar. Similar claims were made in January by her comrades after Channel 2’s investigative magazine Uvda broadcast another Ad Kan, report. That report showed members of Breaking the Silence engaging in what appeared to be various forms of criminal activities with members of Ta’ayush. Those activities included tax evasion and unlawfully interfering with military operations as well as assaulting soldiers.The January report also showed senior Ta’ayush and B’Tselem operatives Ezra Nawi and Nasser Nawaja apparently plotting to turn a Palestinian interested in selling his land to Jews over to Palestinian security services with the full knowledge that they would torture and murder him.B’Tselem’s response to the January report was first to dismiss its legitimacy. Uvda, the group insisted, was wrong to broadcast the report because it was filmed by Ad Kan investigators rather than Uvda reporters.B’Tselem’s claim was particularly rich given that Channel 2 makes liberal use of footage B’Tselem provides its reporters.Just as Novak doubled down on Breaking the Silence’s spying operations, insisting they were legitimate without explaining why, so B’Tselem justified Nawaja’s actions insisting that handing Palestinian land sellers over to the PA is “the only legitimate path available to Palestinians.”B’Tselem didn’t explain why Nawaja didn’t just get his donor friends to buy the land. The self-proclaimed human rights group didn’t explain why its senior employee couldn’t accept the human right of Palestinians to sell their land to Jews or the human right of Jews to buy land from a willing Palestinian seller.B’Tselem didn’t explain why it's legitimate to turn over innocents to PA henchmen with the full knowledge that doing so will lead to their torture and murder.It isn’t that the radical Left’s goal of expelling all Jews and IDF units from Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem is inherently illegitimate -- that is, illegal. It is arguably just as legal as the late Meir Kahane’s goal of expelling all Arabs from Judea and Samaria.But the fact that your goal is legal doesn’t give you the right to break the law. In other words, Breaking the Silence is legitimate. Breaking the law is not.Ad Kan’s revelations are startling not because they call into question the legitimacy of the radical Left’s goal. They are startling because they show that in advancing that goal, radical leftist groups have a distressing comfort level with criminal activities.And this brings us to Novak’s third justification for her group’s intelligence operations.Novak said that Breaking the Silence’s activities are permissible because it always gets the Military Censor’s permission before it publishes its reports. But that merely exacerbates suspicions.If it isn’t publishing the classified information it gathers, why is it gathering it? Whom is it gathering it for? Which brings us to Europe. According to NGO Monitor, in 2014, 61 percent of Breaking the Silence’s budget came from European governments.After Uvda broadcast Ad Kan’s footage of Nawi and Nawaja apparently plotting the murder of an innocent Palestinian in January, British legislators demanded that the Foreign Office justify government funding of B’Tselem.The same parliamentarians could just as easily have asked why their government funds the Palestinian Authority, which murders innocent Palestinians.In the event, once the media storm passed, things went back to normal for the British and their radical leftist agents.Will the same pattern follow today?In the aftermath of the ISIS attacks in Brussels, will Europeans demand to know why European resources are being used to fund espionage against the IDF on the one hand, and Palestinian security services that commit murder and support jihad on the other?Just as Ad Kan’s revelations indicate that law breaking, while not intrinsic to the operations of anti-Zionist, EU-funded Israeli groups, so it would seem that while not intrinsic to anti-Zionist foreign policies, governments that are hostile to Israel tend to have incoherent and incompetent policies for  contending with the threat of jihad.This of course, is eminently predictable. After all, if you believe that Israel is the cause of the pathologies of the Islamic world, then you will likely be blind to the nature of the jihadist threat and the danger it poses to your nation.Following the ISIS strikes in Brussels, both Israeli and American security experts spoke bitterly of the ineptitude of Belgian security services. It is not that the forces themselves are incompetent. Rather, the experts said, their political leadership refuses to allow them to take the actions necessary to protect their country.The Belgians, like their European brethren generally, refuse to deal with jihad. Instead of acknowledging and dealing forthrightly with the phenomenon, they seek every possible excuse to ignore it.According to senior government officials, the Belgians are among the most vociferous foes of Israel in the EU. Europe’s obsessive castigation of Israel is a central aspect of their jihad avoidance strategy. If Israel is to blame for everything, then they can save themselves by pouring billions of euros on the PA and by funding Israeli anti-Zionist subversives.This position is of course irrational and by clinging to it, the Europeans have enabled the jihadist forces arrayed against them to gather and grow.Consider the July 7, 2005, attacks in London. Shortly after they occurred, British investigators discovered that Muhammad Sidique Khan, who led the British al-Qaida cell that carried out the attacks, was connected to the British jihadists who carried out the 2003 suicide bombing at Mike’s Place pub in Tel Aviv, adjacent to the US Embassy.The Mike’s Place bombers were also connected with the radical Left, having toured Israel and Gaza with an International Solidarity Movement group before carrying out their attack.Yet, just as British authorities ignored the significance of the participation of British jihadists in the jihad against Israel 13 years ago, and disregarded the significance of the post-7/7 revelations 11 years ago, so in the intervening years, as jihadist forces grew and spread throughout the continent, rather than shed their hostility toward Israel and stop blaming it for the jihadist Islam, the Europeans expanded their onslaught against the Jewish state.The EU’s subversive activities on the ground massively expanded as did its political and economic war against Israel internationally. The EU’s decision to promote economic boycotts of Israel by labeling Israeli products is just the latest indication that as the threat of jihad grows, the Europeans have doubled down on their campaigns to harm Israel.Is it possible for them to change course?Last week Foreign Ministry director-general Dore Gold visited South Africa. The anti-Israel boycott movement, like the pernicious campaign to libel the Jewish state “apartheid,” was born in South Africa 15 years ago. At the notorious Durban conference on the eve of the September 11, 2001, jihadist attacks, the international NGO movement voted to criminalize the Jewish state.Since 1994, reports have surfaced of jihadist groups, including al-Qaida, Hamas and Hezbollah, operating training camps in South Africa. The order for jihadists to carry out the 2013 massacre at Nairobi’s Westgate Mall reportedly came from al-Qaida operatives in South Africa.Last October, South African President Jacob Zuma hosted Hamas terrorism-master Khaled Mashaal for a four-day visit.During his stay in South Africa, Gold gently tried to explain to his hosts that their support for jihadists and their hostility for Israel would not protect them from the ravages of jihad. But the danger is still too intangible for them. They couldn’t grasp what he was saying.Now that Europe is paying the price for its refusal to contend with the threat of jihad, will its leaders wake up to reality?With ISIS now capable of attacking at will in almost every city in Europe, will they realize that the time has come to stop funding Palestinian jihadists and Israeli subversives? Or is it too late for them to change course?Will they cling to the bitter end to their anti-Semitic delusion that by feeding the Jewish state to the jihadist tiger, he will not come for them?
For Israel, the path is clear regardless of what Europe decides. Our law enforcement bodies need to investigate and prosecute left-wing criminals with the same seriousness they investigate and prosecute all other criminals, regardless of the support they receive from their European funders. And our government needs to pointedly and consistently explain to the leaders of Europe that their assault on Israel will not convince the jihadists to spare them. So far all the Europeans have for their efforts are massacred civilians and shattered defenses.

<title>Column One: The Ellison Challenge</title>
<date>17/11/2016</date>
<content>
The Democratic Party stands at a crossroads today. And so do the Jewish  Democrats.Out of power in the White House and both houses of Congress,  the Democrats must decide what sort of party they will be in the post-Obama  world.




They have two basic options.They can move to the center and  try to rebuild their blue collar voter base that President-elect Donald Trump  captivated with his populist message. To do so they will need to loosen the  reins of political correctness and weaken their racialism, their radical  environmentalism and their support for open borders.This is the sort of  moderate posture that Bill Clinton led with. It is the sort of posture that  Clinton tried but failed to convince his wife to adopt in this year’s  campaign.The second option is to go still further along the leftist  trajectory that President Barack Obama set the party off on eight years ago.  This is the favored option of the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. Sanders’s  supporters refer to this option as the populist course.It is being  played out today on the ground by the anti- Trump protesters who refuse to come  to terms with the Trump victory and insistently defame Trump as a Nazi or Hitler  and his advisers as Goebbels.For the Democrats, such a populist course  will require them to become more racialist, more authoritarian in their  political correctness, angrier and more doctrinaire.It will also require  them to become an antisemitic party.Antisemitism, like hatred of police  and Christians, is a necessary component of Democratic populism.This is  true first and foremost because they will need scapegoats to blame for all the  bad things you can’t solve by demonizing and silencing your political  opponents.Jews, and particularly the Jewish state, along with  evangelical Christians and cops are the only groups that you are allowed to  hate, discriminate against and scapegoat in the authoritarian PC  universe.From the party’s initial post-election moves, it appears that  the Democrats have decided to take the latter path.Congressman Keith  Ellison from Minneapolis is now poised to be selected as the next leader of the  Democratic National Committee. This position is a powerful one. The DNC  chairman, like his Republican counterpart, is the party’s chief  fund-raiser.When a party is out of power, the party chairman is also  treated like its formal leader, and most active spokesman.Ellison is the  head of the Democrats’ Progressive Caucus. His candidacy is supported by  incoming Senate minority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and outgoing Senate minority  leader Harry Reid. Obama has indicated his support for Ellison. Sen. Bernie  Sanders is enthusiastically supporting him.Ellison made history in 2006  when he was elected to serve as the first Muslim member of Congress. As the  representative of an overwhelmingly Democratic district, once he won the  Democratic primary in 2006, he was all but guaranteed that he could serve in  Congress for as long as he wishes.As Scott Johnson, a prominent  conservative writer who runs the popular Power Line blog website reported  extensively in 2006, Ellison is an antisemite. He also defends cop  killers.As Johnson reported, Ellison was a long-standing member of the  antisemitic Nation of Islam. During his 2006 congressional campaign, the local  media gave next to no coverage to this association. But when it did come up,  Ellison soothed concerns of Minneapolis’s Jewish community by sending a letter  to the local Jewish Community Relations Committee.In the letter Ellison  claimed that he had only been briefly associated with Louis Farrakhan’s outfit,  that he was unfamiliar with its antisemitism, and that he had never personally  expressed such views.The local media and the Jewish community were happy  to take him at his word.But as Johnson documented, he was lying on all  counts.Ellison’s association with the Nation of Islam dated back at  least since 1989 and stretched at least until 1998. During that period, he not  only knew about the Nation of Islam’s Jew-hatred, he engaged in it  himself.As Johnson noted, in 1998, Ellison appeared at a public forum as  a spokesman for the Nation of Islam.He was there to defend a woman who  was under fire for allegedly referring to Jews as “among the most racist white  people.”Whereas the woman herself denied she had made the statement,  Ellison defended and justified her alleged statement. Referring to her slander  of Jews he said, “We stand by the truth contained in [the woman’s] remarks...  Also it is absolutely true that merchants in Black areas generally treat Black  customers badly.”As Johnson reported, aside from engaging in anti-Jewish  propaganda and actively promoting antisemitic messages and leaders, decades  before the Black Lives Matter was formed, Ellison was a prominent defender of  murderers of policemen.After the September 11 attacks, Ellison likened  the attacks to the Reichstag fire in 1933, intimating that the al-Qaida strike  was an inside job. He then agreed with an audience member who said that “the  Jews” gained the most from the attacks.As a member of Congress, Ellison  has been among the most hostile US lawmakers toward Israel. He has close  relations with Muslim Brotherhood-related groups like the Council on  American-Islamic Relations and the Islamic Society of North America. Both groups  were unindicted co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation terrorism funding  trial, implicated in funding Hamas and al-Qaida.And now, Sens. Schumer,  Sanders and Reid and President Obama along with the Democratic grassroots  activists and other party leaders are supporting Ellison’s bid to serve as  chairman of the DNC.As Ellison’s statement about “merchants” makes  clear, the Democrats’ Jew-hatred may not be of the “Jews are the sons of apes  and pigs” variety. In all likelihood, it will be propagated through angry  rhetoric about “bankers” and “financiers,” and “the rich.”Ellison, a  supporter of the antisemitic BDS movement, has libeled Israel by likening the  Jewish state to apartheid South Africa. Under his leadership, we can expect for  Democratic politicians to veer even further away from Israel and to embrace the  slander that Zionism is racism.The populist Sanders route seems more  attractive to the Democrats than Bill Clinton’s moderate path because the notion  is taking hold that Sanders would have been a stronger candidate in the general  election than Clinton was.This view is hard to accept. Most Americans  reject socialism, and populist or not, it is difficult to see how Sanders would  have sold his radical positions to an uninterested public.The other  problem with the “Sanders would have won” argument is that it misses the  distinction between Trump’s populism and Democratic populism.Trump’s  populism stemmed from his willingness to say things that other politicians and  authority figures more generally wouldn’t dare to say. Trump’s allegation that  the political system is rigged, for instance, empowered Americans who feel  threatened by the authoritarianism of the politically correct  Left.Trump’s opponents insist that his populism empowered white power  bigots. But that was a bug in his ointment. It wasn’t the ointment itself.  Trump’s willingness to seemingly say anything, and certainly to say things that  were beyond the narrow confines of the politically correct discourse, empowered  tens of millions of voters. It also empowered white bigots at the fringes of the  Right.Whereas empowering white bigots was a side effect of Trump’s  populism, empowering bigots is a central feature of leftist populism. And this  is where it gets dicey for Jews.As Obama – and Ellison – have shown,  when Democrats channel populism, they use it to demonize their opponents as  evil. They are “fat cats on Wall Street.”They are “racists,” and other  deplorables.There are scattered voices on the Left that are calling for  their fellow leftists to revisit their authoritarian practice of labeling  everyone who doesn’t walk lockstep behind them as racists and otherwise  unacceptable. But for the most part, the populists are winning the argument by  essentially demanding more ideological radicalism and more rigidity.This  policy is completely irrational from a political perspective. It’s hard to see  the constituencies that will be swayed to support an angry, hateful  party.But this brings us to the Jews, who voted 3:1 for the Democrats,  and to the American Jewish leadership whose support for Clinton was near  unanimous.When antisemitic, populist voices like Ellison’s began taking  over Britain’s Labour Party, British Jews began heading for the exits. When push  came to shove they preferred their individual rights and their communal rights  as Jews above their partisan loyalties.So far, this doesn’t appear to be  the case among Jewish Democrats.Consider the Anti-Defamation League’s  unhinged onslaught against Trump’s chief strategist, former Breitbart CEO Steve  Bannon.While ignoring Ellison’s record of antisemitism and support for  Israel’s enemies, as well as his ties to unindicted co-conspirators in funding  Hamas, the ADL launched a scathing assault on Bannon, accusing him of being an  antisemite.The ADL’s assault on Bannon follows its absurd claim in the  final days of the campaign that Trump’s ad criticizing George Soros was  antisemitic. It also follows the group’s bizarre condemnation of Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent video clip in which he stated the plain fact that  the Palestinian demand that Jews be ethnically cleansed from the territory they  wish to take control over is an antisemitic demand.As many prominent US  Jews on both sides of the partisan divide have made clear, the accusation that  Bannon, whose Breitbart website is one of the most pro-Israel websites in the  US, is antisemitic is appalling on its face. The allegation is simply  unsubstantiated.So why do it? Why allege that a friend of the Jews is a  Jew-hater while ignoring the actual antisemitism of another man? The answer is  depressingly easy to discern.The ADL appears to be trying to give cover  to the rising forces of antisemitism in the Democratic Party.By falsely  accusing Bannon and through him Trump of antisemitism, the ADL defuses the real  problem of Democratic antisemitism. And if the ADL doesn’t think there is a  problem with Ellison taking over the DNC, but alleges that Republicans hate  them, then rank and file Jews will stay put.The ADL of course isn’t  alone in sending this message.Following the election, Conservative and  Reform congregations in major cities throughout the US organized communal  shivas, to mourn Clinton’s defeat as if it was a death in the family. Such  actions, along with characterizations of Trump and his advisers as Nazis or  Hitler or white supremacists work to bind Jews to a party that is inhospitable  to their communal interests while blinding them to the fact that Republicans do  not hate Jews or the Jewish state.For decades, American Jews have been  at the forefront of every major social movement on in the US.But the  Democratic Party’s move toward antisemitism, a move made apparent through  Ellison’s rise, is one movement the Jews mustn’t  lead.

<title>December 7, 2016: Amona and Hellenists</title>
<date>6/12/2016</date>
<content>
Amona and Hellenists Regarding “Settlement bill advances as Amona hangs in the  balance” (December 6), we’ve heard this before, haven’t we? Peaceful, rural  Amona has seen more than its share of violence – a few years ago, homes were  destroyed by the government for phantom/fantasy Arab “landowners.”




Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is talking out of both sides of his mouth, with  forked lips or whatever colorful euphemism you’d like to use. And when he and  Bayit Yehudi chairman Naftali Bennett went head-to-head concerning Amona,  Bennett blinked.No great surprise. We have a government that the media  love to label as right-wing, but those of us who are truly on the Right believe  in the primacy of Jewish rights to live on our holy land and want the State of  Israel to be fully sovereign, not just playacting when campaigning for our  votes.Why does the same government that is planning to move the  tax-paying, productive and patriotic Jewish families of Amona legalize Beduin  squatter encampments in southern Israel and other locations? Why can’t the  retroactive legislation include Amona? The left-wing establishment here in  Israel expected the disengagement from the Gaza Strip to break us, but we are  bitter, not brittle. We are like the grape vines that grow through cracks  in cement. We have survived many enemies, Jewish as well as  non-Jewish.As we prepare to celebrate the Hanukka holiday, we are  reminded of the Hellenists who tried to adopt Greek values and endanger the Jews  who remained loyal to God and Judaism. When will we ever learn? BATYA MEDAD  
Shiloh What would we call the people living in Amona if these were the times of  the British Mandate? We would hail them as heroes because they stand up for  their rights! Now that Israel has its own government, though, the rules are  different. The High Court of Justice acts in a way that the people of  Israel never would have accepted under the British.The court must  finally understand that justice is not blind, and that there are reality  factors, mainly in human lives, that warrant legal interpretations meant to be  lived with.As our national anthem states, we are “a free people in a  free land.”TOBY WILLIG 
Jerusalem Not racist Ruthie Blum’s “Note to  Israelis: The US is not racist” (Right from Wrong, December 5) rings so true to  me after having just returned from a holiday in the US, where we spent time in  Orlando, New Orleans and Philadelphia, and mingled liberally with the  masses.Most every time, we were asked where we came from, and we said  “Israel.” We encountered enthusiasm from the people (none of them Jewish),  including a large number of Uber taxi drivers, both men and women, who came from  all walks of life. Some even became emotional and said they must visit Israel,  “an amazing place.”No politics emerged anywhere. It’s definitely  the media that’s to blame.LINDA STERN 
Safed Ruthie Blum hits the nail on  the head when she concludes that “there is nothing but skewed coverage of the  Trump phenomenon to suggest that racism is rampant in US.” But it is a sad  commentary on the state of media reporting.In the past year or so,  pundits have unsuccessfully attempted to manipulate polls and distort  information to the public. At times, they have emphasized the trivial, whether  it’s Trump’s “locker-room boasting” or Sara Netanyahu’s collection of empty  bottles, while minimizing information, such as the benefits for British citizens  of leaving the European Union.Despite the doomsayers’ predictions of  impending calamity, Englishmen are on the road to increased prosperity, and  Benjamin Netanyahu remains our prime minister, with no serious  opponents. Now, Donald Trump, with his outstanding cabinet choices, can  truly reposition the US to attain its former position of  greatness.

Jerusalem Outrageous comparison Oren Kesler’s  “Netanyahu, like Castro, will never change” (Comment & Features, December 5)  is the most outrageous comparison I have ever seen about Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu – and there is a very large selection to choose from in the  media.No matter what one thinks of Netanyahu, his personality and/or his  policies, it is reprehensible to compare him to a murderer and dictator such as  Fidel Castro. Mr. Kesler owes not only the prime minister, but also the  Jewish people an apology.ELI SCHMELL 
Rehovot 

Oren Kesler is credited as  being an expert on Latin America. Maybe that explains the bizarre content of his  piece, since democracy has not been a significant element in the history of that  region’s countries, which have been more inclined to revolution and dictatorship  for the past 100 years.What is especially egregious is Kesler’s likening  of Fidel Castro, one of the worst despots in recent history – and not just in  Latin America – with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Whatever one might say  about the prime minister’s positions, policies and ambitions, you have to agree  that he is the elected leader of a fully democratic country, while Castro was  the self-appointed, autocratic ruler of a subject people that had absolutely no  say in his policies.Saying, as Kesler does, that Netanyahu is navigating  Israel onto the same road as Cuba under Castro is ridiculous, if not actually  insulting to the Israeli electorate, which put our prime minister where he  is.HENRY KAYE

UN protection With regard to “UNGA passes six  votes condemning Israel, again” (December 1), the Palestinians, as a people,  were created in 1964 when the KGB and Egypt set up the PLO to drive the Jews out  of Israel.From the start of the British Mandate for Palestine until  1948, only local Jews referred to themselves as Palestinians. Arabs identified  with their countries of origin: They were Egyptians, Syrians, etc. According to  “The Smoking Gun: Arab Immigration into Palestine, 1922-1931” by Fred M.  Gottheil (Middle East Quarterly, Winter 2003), most migrated to Palestine in the  1920s and ’30s at the encouragement of their leaders and to find  employment.The PLO refined terrorism as a means of diplomacy. It  invented airplane hijacking for political purposes and was successful in  projecting its cause onto the world stage.Suicide bombings and vehicles  ramming into crowds are more recent innovations, as are arson and knife attacks.  These modes of destruction are now standard Islamist terror methods used  internationally. In addition, the BDS movement and claims of Israeli  “apartheid” are Palestine’s way of harassing Jewish university  students.For these achievements, the Palestinians are protected by the  United Nations.

<title>My word: Double takes and double standards</title>
<date>7/1/2016</date>
<content>
I once heard Bennie Begin tell a joke that seems to fit the first week of the  new year. When Begin, then a Likud lawmaker, was asked about his opinion of the  Oslo Process, he likened it to the man who jumps out of a window of a 25-story  building. As he passes the 17th floor, someone calls out “How do you feel?” and  receives the reply “So far, so good.”We’re all going to need some dark  humor to get us through 2016, if the first week was anything to go by.




Of  course, the fact that one of the biggest stories of 2015 was the massacre at the  editorial offices of Charlie Hebdo on January 7 meant I didn’t have great  expectations at a global level last year either. And I wasn’t disappointed.  After the attack at the Hyper Casher kosher supermarket in which four Jews were  killed two days later, the perpetrators were described by President Barack Obama  “as a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a  bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.”That set the tone for the rest of the  year. Paris returned to the news in November, when the vicious bunch proved to  be more organized, more violent – and more jihadist – than Obama was willing to  admit.The attacks on the Jews – which continued throughout Europe,  throughout the year – got a lot less attention.But the decision by many  major cities to cancel or tone down their New Year festivities and fireworks for  fear of terrorism says a lot.I was thinking of the Hyper Casher victims  as I was getting ready for Shabbat last week. After all, they had been doing  their last-minute pre-Sabbath preparations when they were murdered.The  generally low-key Friday afternoon Israel Radio broadcasts were disturbed by the  breaking news of the terrorist attack at a street cafe/bar in Tel Aviv. By the  time I turned my radio off for Shabbat it was clear that two young Jewish men  had been killed. (The terrorist later apparently also killed a Muslim taxi  driver.) It was not “a random attack on a bunch of folks” celebrating a friend’s  birthday party on New Year’s Day: It was an assault on the heart of Tel Aviv.  Dizengoff Street, though not what it was in its heyday, remains a symbol of all  that is considered cool and trendy in the City that Never Sleeps.It  reminded me of the way that the terrorists in the Paris attacks two months ago  also shot at a street cafe, targeting the young and the carefree.Paris  and Brussels, where at least some of the terrorists lived, went into a  lockdown.Tel Aviv slowed down but didn’t come to a halt.Many  Jerusalemites watched with sympathy mixed with surprise.In the capital,  we take constant criticism for the way police, security forces and armed  citizens swiftly respond to attacks: First aiming to put the perpetrator out of  action and if that fails or isn’t feasible, shooting to kill.Jerusalem  schools held a mini-strike until the number of hours guards were present was  increased. Many Tel Avivians kept their children at home altogether.Tel  Aviv, understandably, worried that there was an armed mass murderer on the  loose. Jerusalem, sadly, assumes that there’s always someone out there who wants  to kill and maim and destroy our way of life.Jerusalemites months ago  launched the Eati-fada, a campaign to encourage people to eat out especially  during the terror wave, to help local businesses; Tel Avivians called to each  other this week to carry on having coffee out as normal.On Saturday  night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to the site of the Tel Aviv attack  and, next to the memorial candles for Shimon (Shimi) Ruime and Alon Bakal, gave  a speech addressing, mainly, the Israeli-Arab community. By that point, the  father of the shooter had identified his son who was still on the run and the  whole country knew that the wanted attacker was 31-year-old Nashat Milhem, a  resident of the Arab town of Arara.“There are many among Muslim-Israeli  citizens who have come out against the violence and are crying out for full law  enforcement in their towns. At the same time, we all know that there is wild  incitement by radical Islam against the State of Israel in the Arab  sector.Incitement in mosques, in the education system, on social media,”  the prime minister said, announcing a crackdown on illegal arms.“We will  demand loyalty to the laws of the state from everyone,” he continued. “One  cannot say ‘I am Israeli in my rights and Palestinian in my responsibilities.’  Whoever wants to be Israeli, must be Israeli all the way, with rights and  responsibilities, and the first and foremost responsibility is to follow the  laws of the state.”Netanyahu praised Israeli Arabs who enlist in the IDF  or do civilian national service, and called “on all Israeli citizens, and  especially Muslim-Israeli citizens, to follow this path, a path of integration,  coexistence and peace, and not a path of incitement, hatred and  zealotry.“We are all citizens of the State,” he  said.Predictably, his opponents – and they are many – jumped at his  choice of words and accused him of marking a whole sector.I was struck,  not for the first time, by the similarity of his speech to that of British Prime  Minister David Cameron. (Both got into hot water last year for different  comments: Cameron’s referring to migrants as “a swarm of people coming across  the Mediterranean, seeking a better life’’; Netanyahu saying on election day  that the Arab voters were “heading to the polling stations in droves.” Cameron  managed to live the comments down; Netanyahu is still constantly reminded of his  unfortunate phrasing.) In his New Year speech, Cameron said, “When our national  security is threatened by a seething hatred of the West, one that turns people  against their country and can even turn them into murderous extremists, I want  us to be very clear: You will not defeat us. And we will not just confront the  violence and the terror.“We will take on their underlying, poisonous  narrative of grievance and resentment. We will come down hard on those who  create the conditions for that narrative to flourish. And we will have greater  confidence in – indeed, we will revel in – our way of life.“Because if  you walk our streets, learn in our schools, benefit from our society, you sign  up to our values: freedom; tolerance; responsibility; loyalty.”Cameron  also got flak from his political rivals, but the speech was not instantly shared  and tweeted around the world as an example of racism.Only Israel’s prime  minister is considered racist when he tries to tackle terrorism at the  source.It was similar to the reaction to Israel’s proposed legislation  requiring nonprofit organizations (Left or Right, by the way) to clearly declare  funding they receive from foreign governments in all public communications and  contacts with Israeli government officials and to wear a special badge when  attending Knesset meetings.A colleague this week shared a Washington  Post editorial titled “A Danger to Israeli Democracy” (January 2) casually  dropping a mention of similarities to Vladimir Putin’s Russia and legislation in  China.“Israel should not allow itself to be lumped with these regimes,”  opined the editorial.I agree. We should not be lumped together with  these regimes. As the editorial itself noted, “Israel’s democracy has been a  pillar of strength through years of siege.”And, while not perfect,  Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked’s proposals don’t remind me of either of those  regimes (which strangely are not singled out by the BDS movement as targets for  boycott, divestment and sanctions).It reminds me of America’s Foreign  Agents Registration Act whose purpose, according to the FAQs on its own website,  “is to insure that the US Government and the people of the United States are  informed of the source of information (propaganda) and the identity of persons  attempting to influence US public opinion, policy and laws.”More double  standards in a dangerous world.Channel 10’s Tzinur show this week  reported that the British Parliament had discussed Israel some 350 times in  2015: That’s approximately 50 more discussions and parliamentary questions than  it held on ISIS last year. The figure seemed so high, I  double-checked.Unfortunately, it’s correct. The British Parliament was  more concerned with Israel’s “evils” than with those of Islamic  State.Back to Paris: Another double take.According to an Israel  Radio report, protesters wearing keffiyehs and carrying Palestinian flags and  anti-Israel placards managed to get into the performance by the Israeli Bat  Sheva Dance Company on January 5 (so much for the French concept of heightened  security) ahead of a performance of “Three” by superb choreographer Ohad  Naharin.The pro-Palestinians at the Opera de Paris shouted messages such  as “One doesn’t dance with apartheid” and called Israelis “murderers” and  “colonizers,” particularly in Gaza.Similar slogans are frequently  sounded by similar demonstrators in other European capitals and  cities.It makes me wonder where these people live.This week,  Israel coped with lethal and non-lethal terror attacks (not just in Tel Aviv)  and Hezbollah operated a large bomb aimed at IDF soldiers on the Israel-Lebanon  border. And Israelis are very aware that Islamist terrorists in Gaza occupy  themselves by sporadically firing rockets on Israeli  communities.Meanwhile, the bloodbath – Muslim against Muslim – continues  in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere (with the biggest question being who’s been using  chemical weapons).The Sunni-Shi’a divide turned into a gaping chasm as  both Saudi Arabia and Iran did what they do best – the former executing a Shi’a  cleric, the latter storming the Saudi Embassy. The tremors from the widening  split were felt in places far away such as Sudan and Yemen.Talking of  tremors, the world is engaged in a guessing game over what exactly North Korea  (Iran’s ally) is playing at with its missile testing. No, I don’t think  all’s well with the world at the start of 2016. But as I’ve said before,  singling out Israel for double standards and special treatment is not the  answer.
Terrorism in Tel Aviv is not about “the settlements” any more  than terror attacks in Paris are about poverty.

<title>Dr. Melville Edelstein and South Africa’s 1976 Soweto uprising</title>
<date>29/6/2016</date>
<content>
Dr. Melville Edelstein, a Jewish social worker killed during the “student  uprisings” of June 16, 1976, was recently commemorated in Soweto, the famous  township outside of Johannesburg, South Africa. The township is known for its  role in the fight to end apartheid. The student uprising, a pivotal struggle in  the anti-apartheid campaign, began as a peaceful protest against the use of  Afrikaans as the language of instruction in the township schools. During the  protest, the police began firing indiscriminately at large crowds of students,  killing an unknown number of people.The event sent shockwaves through  the international community as images of dead children made the front pages of  newspapers from the United States to Germany. In addition to igniting global  outrage, the student uprising marked the beginning of the end of apartheid, as  waves of violent protest soon followed within South Africa.




In the middle  of a crisp winter morning members of the Edelstein family and their friends  arrived by motorcade to the Morris Isaacson High School, where Dr. Edelstein was  killed during the protests. The school, built by a Jewish philanthropist in  1956, was an important gathering point during the uprising.Joining the  family were the major of Johannesburg, Parks Tau, premier of Gauteng, David  Makhura, minister in the presidency, Jeff Radebe, as well as a host of other  political party and government officials, rabbis, Jewish community  representatives and residents of Soweto whose relatives had also been killed  that day. The event was the first of a number of official ceremonies to mark the  40th anniversary of the protests. The day is now an official holiday in South  Africa and is known as Youth Day. Dignitaries gave speeches regarding the  importance of the gathering and unveiled a new plaque commemorating the  contribution of Dr. Melville to the people of Soweto. A member of the mayoral  committee said that in time a statue would also be erected.The unveiling  was especially poignant because it coincided with the bar mitzva of Edelstein’s  grandchild Levi Rosenthal. After the official ceremony, the family, along with  friends, supporters and rabbi, came together for a morning prayer  service.The bar mitzva boy was called up to a makeshift bimah (podium)  to read from a small Torah scroll.While a curious crowd gathered on the  nearby street singing anti-apartheid songs, the bar mitzva party filled the air  with strains of “siman tov u’mazal tov” as the portion was concluded.Dr.  Edelstein was born in the small South African hamlet of King Williams Town in  1919 to Lithuanian/ Latvian emigrant parents, and was one of three siblings. An  introverted child, he led a colorful life as an irreligious young intellectual  studying in the United Kingdom during World War II. There he found and married  his first wife, Isabel Green. The couple would have two children after moving  back to South Africa. Still searching for meaning in life he traveled to Israel  in 1954 and considered making aliya but was torn about leaving South Africa and  his family. While in Israel, Edelstein made a trip to Sde Boker and stayed with  David and Paula Ben-Gurion, to whom he explained his dilemma. Paula told him  that “happiness resides in the bluebird of your back garden.” He eventually  moved to South Africa and started doing social work in Soweto. Edelstein also  got divorced and later remarried and had two more children, Janet and Shana,  with his new wife, Rhona.Edelstein was a popular member of the Soweto  community and employed by a government department called the Western Areas Bantu  Administration, which dealt with welfare in the community.His particular  focus was helping young people and the disabled find adequate education and  employment.During his tenure there he completed a master’s dissertation  on the attitudes of Soweto youth toward the apartheid government.His  research indicated that violence would occur if oppressive laws against black  South Africans were not reviewed and revoked.Although the government  read the report, it ignored the findings.On the day the protests began,  Edelstein was opening a new employment center. When he heard about the protests,  he rushed back to his offices, worried about the safety of his coworkers.  Unbeknownst to him, his coworkers had already escaped. While there an angry mob  broke into the building and stoned him to death. Reporter Peter Magubane later  found his body with a note saying “Beware Afrikaans is the most dangerous drug  for our future.” The reporter said, “If they’d known who he was, this would  never have happened.”Dr. Edelstein’s daughter, Janet Goldblatt, said,  “He loved the people of Soweto almost like he did his own family. He believed  all should be educated equally.”Dr. Edelstein was also active in the  Jewish community and volunteered at The South African Jewish orphanage known as  Arcadia. He was also a member of the Sydenham- Highlands North Hebrew  Congregation which he joined when he became more observant later on in life. The  synagogue houses another plaque erected by the Jewish community commemorating  his work and contribution.Several years ago a documentary was made about  the life and times of Dr. Edelstein and the events that led to his death. It was  replayed by the national broadcaster in honor of the 40-year anniversary of  Youth Day and can be viewed on YouTube.

<title>Editorial: Campus challenge</title>
<date>1/9/2016</date>
<content>
With the academic year set to begin at universities throughout  North America next week, Jewish students who care about Israel are going to face  some daunting challenges.As laid out in a widely disseminated column  published in The Washington Post recently by McGill University junior Molly  Harris, titled, “So you’re a Jew and you’re starting college? Prepare for  anti-Zionism,” elements of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic overtones are common  place on her campus in Montreal, and have also been reported on campuses  throughout the US.




Last week, the atmosphere Harris described was also  reported by Milan Chatterjee, a former UCLA student president, who informed the  university that he would be leaving due to a “hostile and unsafe campus climate”  created by pro-BDS organizations.Chatterjee told the Los Angeles Jewish  Journal that he has been harassed and discriminated against because he “refused  to support an anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist activity, organization and position  while serving as president of the UCLA Graduate Student  Association.”Another worrisome aspect of North American campus life  Harris described was the growing tendency to exclude Israel-friendly Jewish  students from social justice campaigns and organizations.That trend may  intensify following the release of Black Lives Matter’s platform last month. The  popular left-wing cause, which many US Jewish organizations and campus groups  have vocally supported, outrageously called Israel an “apartheid state” and  accused the United States of complicity in Israel’s “genocide” against the  Palestinians.One of America’s leading Jewish voices, Barry Shrage, the  president and CEO of the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston, is a longtime  supporter of forming alliances between the American Jewish community and other  American minorities.But following BLM’s platform, he recently told a  group of young Jewish professionals who are heading out this month to circulate  among major US campuses advocating for Israel, that there is no turning a blind  eye to such blindly hateful and false claims. The challenge of the campus Israel  advocates, he said, was to convey to Jewish students that “we can have sympathy,  love and commitment to the cause of humanity, but we also have to take care of  our own people.“We have a primary responsibility – if I am not for  myself, then who will be?” he added, citing Pirke Avot, The Ethics of the  Fathers.Thankfully, Israel and its supporters are not alone to fight the  poisonous atmosphere that has emerged on some campuses. The BDS movement has  suffered a series of setbacks in its efforts to delegitimize Israel.More  than a dozen US states have adopted anti-BDS legislation this year, including  Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, South Carolina and Iowa. And just  this week, the California State Assembly voted unanimously to send an anti-BDS  bill to Gov. Jerry Brown for signature.Also this summer, New York’s Gov.  Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order banning state companies from  collaborating with entities that promote BDS.Legislation and executive  orders are welcome and necessary, but the real change is going to come through  educating American Jews – beginning with college students – that integrating  their traditional identification with the universal cause of aiding the underdog  does not have be mutually exclusive with standing up for Israel.That  does not mean blind support for the Jewish homeland and the policies of its  government. Israel has its problems, like any country. And as long as the  conflict over land with the Palestinians continues, it is valid to passionately  argue in favor or against a onestate solution, a two-state solution, annexation,  withdrawal or any other plan that might result in a workable solution for both  Israelis and Palestinians. There are many ways to be pro-Israel, on and off  campus.What is not valid are efforts to delegitimize, boycott or  demonize Israel, or to stand aside while others, especially those like BLM and  the BDS movement, do so in a bullying fashion that puts pro-Israel student  activists in danger.
This semester, Jewish students on North American  campuses have a fresh chance to get involved and take a stand when Israel is  included in a list of the evils of the world. As Shrage pointed out: If we are  not for ourselves, who will be for us?

<title>Encountering Peace: Left, Right, Zionist, anti-Zionist</title>
<date>5/10/2016</date>
<content>
I just came back from a lecture in Mexico. I was invited by the amazing Jewish  community of Mexico City and had an fabulous and intensive week there including:  a public lecture for more than 250 people at the CDI, the Jewish community  sports center, marking the conclusion of a week of peace activities there; a  separate evening lecture to more than 50 leaders of the CDI; a talk with 9th  graders at Beit Hayeladim school – this was a high point for me; a lecture to  undergraduate students of international relations at Ahahuac University on  lessons learned from the failed Israeli-Palestinian peace process; a talk to 30  teachers from Mexico City’s Jewish schools at the Yavne School about education  for peace; a tour of Jewish Mexico city with the amazing Monica Unikel; a public  lecture at the Museum of Memory and Tolerance on hope, peace and strategic  choices; an evening with 65 “non-hasbara members of the Jewish community”  focusing on what Mexican Jewry can do to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace and  peace within the community; and a lecture to high school students at the Colegio  Israelita De Mexico (Idishe school) on Israel’s future, Shimon Peres and  peace.At the talk for some 150 high school students at the Idishe  school, one bright young man asked me: are you on the Right or the Left? This is  not an uncommon question to me.




This is what I said: tell me please, is  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the Right or the Left? I then repeated some  of Netanyahu’s statements on the world stage of the United Nations – about the  Palestinian state, Arab peace initiative, teaching Arabic to all Jewish  Israelis, that Israel will make peace with all of its neighbors. The student was  clearly confused. Yes, the prime minister of Israel, the leader of the rightwing  Likud Party sounded like a leading leftist. I said I didn’t know what Left and  Right mean in Israel when it comes to peace and security. I am a Zionist, I  said.What is a Zionist? A Zionist is someone who believes in and works  for the existence of a democratic nation state for the Jewish people. Israel was  established on two pillars – two foundations. Israel is a democratic state; I  would not want to live in a non-democratic one. Israel is the nation state of  the Jewish people. I made aliya to our home 38 years ago because Israel is the  democratic nation-state of the Jewish people.I would not have made aliya  and I would not have left the United States if Israel was something else. Yet  today, Israel’s future regarding these two pillars is in danger. For almost 50  years there has been a binational, one-state reality threatening either the  democratic nature of Israel or its Jewish character. If Israel fails to end its  control over the Palestinian people Israel will either cease to be democratic or  the nation-state of the Jewish people. What needs to be done is  clear.Those who work to prevent the partition of the Land of Israel into  two states for two peoples are anti-Zionists because they seek to change  Israel’s character to being either non-democratic or not being the nation-state  of the Jewish people. Those who support building settlements in the parts of the  Land which must become the Palestinian state are anti-Zionist. Yes – that’s  right – those who work to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, on  only 22 percent of the land between the River and the Sea (that was the  underlying deal in Oslo), are working to bring about a one-state reality which  is either anti-democratic in which there are two peoples under separate and  unequal political and economic realities controlled by Israel, sometimes known  as a new form of apartheid, or a state which could no longer be defined as the  nation-state of the Jewish people, because in a very short time there will be a  Palestinian Arab majority there.It is not a question of Right or Left –  as I told the young Mexican Jewish students. It is a question of whether or not  you are a Zionist. I am a Zionist. I believe in and work to secure the security  and stability of a democratic nation-state for the Jewish people.Prime  Minister Netanyahu spoke in the United Nations as a Zionist. Now the question is  whether or not he will lead the State of Israel in the coming near future as a  Zionist. The choice is clear: two states for two people – the democratic  nation-state of the Jewish people living side-by-side with the nation state of  the Palestinian people – or one-state for two peoples, which will either be a  democratic binational state or a non-democratic apartheid state which by  definition cannot be Jewish.

<title>The Left is right</title>
<date>25/5/2016</date>
<content>
The Israeli Right is in power and clearly has the support of the majority of  Israelis. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was elected  democratically and its rule is without any doubt legitimate, but it is equally  important to remember that the existence of an opposition to the government is  central to Israel’s democratic system.The responsibility of the  coalition is to rule and the responsibility of the opposition and to present a  credible alternative to the policies, principles and execution of those policies  and principles to the public.




With regard to the number one problem  facing Israel – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the almost 50-year  binational state reality – which has become an existential issue regarding  Israel’s ability to continue to be the democratic nation-state of the Jewish  people, the current government not only hasn’t done anything, it has no policy,  no direction and no vision. Keeping the status quo of not making decisions  regarding Israel’s eastern border seems to be the only policy this government  has on the issue. There is no status quo in conflict realities and the lack of  movement has deep repercussions on other key issues facing Israel – such as  relations between the Jewish majority of Israel and the Palestinian Arab  minority.The lack of any genuine political process or negotiations with  the Palestinians also has deep negative impacts on the economy, and the  continued decline in tourism is only one of the indicators.One of the  complicating factors is that the opposition in Israel has also failed, like the  ruling coalition, to present any viable alternatives to the public. The leaders  of the opposition, both from the Zionist Union and Yesh Atid, have mainly  focused on competing with the coalition leader in trying to present better  status-quo options. In his attempts to be more Right than the Right, Zionist  Union leader Isaac Herzog wants to build more walls and fences, and Yesh Atid  chairman Yair Lapid competes with Netanyahu in inciting against the Palestinians  – including those who are Israeli citizens. And none of them, in the coalition  or the opposition, have any clue regarding the future of Gaza.Even though Netanyahu has done nothing to advance the two-state solution, he adheres  to that solution publicly because he knows there is no other option. Netanyahu  knows that the Left is right: there is no one-state solution. There is no  sustainable future for Israel which enables Israel to annex the West  Bank.The problem is not only demography, as the basically racist  argument of the Labor Party goes. Regardless of the numbers, Israel cannot be a  democratic state and at the same time continue to rule over millions of people  who are denied basic human and civil rights.The “solution” until now has  been that inside of the Green Line Israel is a democracy, albeit a challenged  one, while outside the Green Line the Palestinians have self-rule under the  Palestinian Authority, which is at best a lie. The notion of self-rule of the  Palestinians in the PA-controlled areas A and B according to their Oslo  agreement definition might hold water if there was some genuine prospect of a  peace agreement in the foreseeable future. The designation of different statuses  for land areas in the West Bank was part of an interim agreement for a period of  five years which was supposed to end in 1999. The designation of the entire West  Bank by Israel as “disputed” territory after 1967 might have had some validity a  long time ago – but it has been in that temporary mode for almost 50 years. At  some point, temporary becomes permanent. And even if the word “occupation” is  politically unpopular, there is no other word to describe what exists  there.The apartheid-like reality of dual regimes under one state – with  only Israel holding real authority in the West Bank – endangers Israel’s very  existence, and not for reasons of physical security. The danger is in the direct  threat to Israel’s existence as a democracy.Israel’s military control  over millions of Palestinians in the West Bank cannot in any way be considered  suitable for a democracy.The only solution that is viable for the future  of Israel is the solution of the Left – two states for two peoples. The only  viability for peace is based on ending Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian  people and the creation of a viable Palestinian state next to Israel. That can  only be done by accepting the most fundamental idea that peace is created by  people – real people – interacting, crossing borders, working together – not  building more walls, fences and cages.If Israel is to survive and to be  a place worthy of living in, it will come back to the ideology of the Left,  which will be embraced by the future leaders of the Right. Those who will not  accept this idea are actively working for the destruction of Israel and its  democracy.The use of Hamas-controlled Gaza as an excuse to not make  decisions only postpones the inevitable, making it more difficult with each  passing day to implement in the future. The government should deal with the West  Bank before it too becomes a territory threatened with fundamentalist Islamic  control as well.For Israel’s sake, embrace the Left and make it  right.

<title>European politicians try (and fail) to manipulate Israeli legislation</title>
<date>15/2/2016</date>
<content>
In the midst of Israel’s intense debate on legislation in response to massive  European government funding for political NGOs (non-governmental organizations),  some European politicians decided to join the fray. Their letters, publicized in  the media or via the Internet by the writers themselves, sought to halt the  debate – a point not lost on many Israelis, who view European NGO funding as  blatant meddling in domestic affairs.These letters contained a number of  inaccuracies that misrepresented the legislation and repeated the slogans of  their Israeli NGO clients. These actions were another sign that for many  European officials, Israeli sovereignty and democracy are limited, and subject  to external pressure and manipulation.




MEP Julie Ward (S&D, UK) was  the driving force behind the most publicized letter, circulating the text and  asking her colleagues to join in urging Israel to reject the legislation. Out of  751 MEPs, she gathered only 50 signatures, many from politicians with a proven  record of anti-Israel lobbying, including Ward herself.In contrast to  the letter’s faux expressions of concern for the “Israeli interest” and fear of  “damaging Israeli’s standing in the world,” Ward has a long record of attacking  the Jewish state. She is a vocal proponent of BDS (boycott, divestment and  sanctions), and was an initiator of a 2014 petition calling on the EU to suspend  trade agreements with Israel. That petition notes that BDS “takes its  inspiration from the successful boycott campaign” against “the South African  apartheid regime,” promoting the vile and false comparison between Israel and  apartheid. Outrageously the petition claims “Israel would not be able to carry  out its brutal mass killings and maintain its repressive regime without the  support by the EU and the United States.” In addition, joining a 2015 open  letter, Ward called on EU officials to exclude an Israeli hi-tech firm from the  Horizon 2020 R&D framework.The letter repeated claims made by the  pro-BDS “Stop the Wall” group.Many of the 50 MEPs who signed Ward’s  letter on NGO funding participated in the earlier petitions and campaigns to  demonize and isolate Israel. For example, MEP Barbara Spinelli (GUE, Italy) has  made many hostile statements on Israel and Jews, saying “Israel constitutes a  scandal.” And MEP Patrick Le Hyaric (GUE, France), who openly supports and  promotes BDS efforts.Le Hyaric called on Europeans to “exert real  pressure on Israel by developing an economic boycott” in a piece he penned for  Le Monde.In addition to Ward’s missive, another letter – addressed to  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – was leaked to Haaretz, signed by four German  MEPs, including Alexander Graf Lambsdorf (ALDE) and Arne Lietz (S&D).  Although seemingly reflecting good-faith concerns (in contrast to Ward) that the  foreign NGO funding law would “infringe on the freedom of expression in Israel  and in turn harm relations,” evidence suggests that these MEPs were not well  informed, and their language was at least influenced by the Israeli NGO  lobby.For instance, the MEPs repeated the standard and baseless concern  that the minor transparency additions would somehow “complicate, if not  obstruct, the work of various NGOs.”These European letters, and a third  – also from German politicians, including Volker Beck (Greens) – pointedly omit  any mention of the nature and scale of the NGOs targeting Israel, which has no  parallel elsewhere.Tens of millions of euros are provided annually and  without independent oversight to fringe NGOs, all on one side of the political  spectrum. Many of these groups work primarily to promote BDS and demonization  against Israel around the world. To similarly influence American politics and  society, Europe would need to channel at least one billion dollars to groups  focusing on issues such as gun control, abortion or immigration. Obviously,  Europe would not do this, but in the case of Israel, such blatant intervention,  including the efforts to prevent legislation, is standard  behavior.Another question repeated by the European politicians is why  “privately funded NGOs with substantial impact on Israeli politics... are  excluded” from the proposed law. Indeed, this is a serious question, and must be  addressed. At the same time, there are also important differences that justify  separate consideration of the different funding sources. States are sovereign  entities and each democratic society must determine its own course, and not be  the subject of external manipulation.For all of these reasons, the  attempts by the European politicians to sway the Israeli debate on these  important issues were not only ignored; they were rejected, even by opponents of  the NGO legislation. If European officials are truly bothered by the proposed  NGO funding transparency law, they should take action which would make it  unnecessary. For example, negotiation of NGO funding guidelines with their  Israeli counterparts could be a viable alternative.

<title>Frustrated and confused: A Liberal Zionist and the Black Lives Matter movement</title>
<date>7/9/2016</date>
<content>
I am Jewish. I am a Zionist. I fight for social justice. These three aspects  shape my identity. Growing up, Judaism, Zionism and social justice complimented  each other to create someone who loves Israel, is a strong Jew and cares deeply  about the world around her. Why then, am I suddenly confused, conflicted, and  hurt? Because the Black Lives Matter movement, one of if not the most important  social justice movements of my generation, released a policy platform that  inexplicably includes language that demonizes and dehumanizes  Israelis.From a young age, I understood the concept of being treated  differently because of one’s heritage and the importance of fighting for social  justice for all. At family dinners, I heard how my great-grandfather escaped a  deadly anti-Semitic Eastern Europe. They and my grandparents were proud Jews,  even though being Jewish meant a harder and more dangerous life. They identified  as an oppressed minority. When Martin Luther King Jr. marched in the streets of  Washington, DC, for justice for African Americans, my great-grandmother boarded  a bus to join him, because she, like many other Jews, believed that oppressed  minorities had the responsibility to help each other out.




I hold the  Civil Rights Movement and the fight for racial equality in America close to my  heart and believe they are deeply connected to my people’s history. When I was  young, I always chose to read about the underground railroad, Brown vs. Board of  Education, incarceration and inner city schools and communities. I learned about  the role American Jewish rabbis, business leaders and politicians played in  helping to pass civil rights legislation in the 1960s. I became passionate about  helping to change the oppression that is so often perpetuated within the  American education, judicial and economic systems. In Judaism we call this  “Tikkun Olam” (repair the world) and I take this to heart.However, as a  freshman in college these three aspects of my identity were challenged, not by  me but by others declaring that civil rights, Israel and Judaism could not  coexist or compliment each other, but actually contradicted one  another.Saddened, angry and frustrated at the violence and racial  tensions between police and African Americans – similar to other students – I  attended a demonstration in support of the Black Lives Matter  movement. It seemed natural, almost instinctive of me to participate.  Yet, it was at this protest against racism that I encountered racism against  Jews for the first time. I overheard many students blaming my community for  “privilege and control of the government and media.” This was confusing  and hurtful, and only the start of my realization that the current world of  social justice, that I have always been so passionate about, did not want me and  all parts of my identity.This sentiment of exclusion was further  validated when the BLM movement released an anti-Israel platform.The  Movement for Black Lives platform’s statement that Israel is an enforcer of the  “genocide taking place against Palestinian people” is absolutely false. There is  no genocide taking place against the Palestinians, nor has there ever  been. In 1967 after the Six Day war, Israel acquired the West Bank and  Gaza with its half a million Palestinian residents. Since 1967, the Palestinian  population there has more than tripled. Add to this the endless Palestinian  lives that have been saved and treated in Israeli hospitals, and through  preventative military measures in Gaza to reduce civilian casualties, preserving  Palestinian lives, not destroying them.The further claim that Israel is  an apartheid state is not only false but offensive to those who actually  suffered apartheid. None of Israel’s laws promote apartheid, nor does it  practice apartheid in the West Bank or Gaza. Israeli law protects equal rights  for all of its citizens, who are able to freely participate in all aspects of  society. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have their own governments and  the vast majority want their own state, not citizenship in  Israel.Additionally, why does BLM focus solely on Israel as the only one  responsible for the conflict and ignore how Palestinian leaders continue to make  decisions that harm Israelis and Palestinians alike? And why is there no mention  of the brutal human rights violations inflicted against black people by Arab  states and racist terrorist groups like Hamas? By overreaching into matters that  have nothing to do with systematic racial inequality in the United States, BLM  is alienating Americans who are or can be their best allies. By  demonizing Israel, ignoring the struggles of Israelis and supporting the racism  of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, BLM is fostering further hate  and racial biases rather than working to eradicate racial inequality.I  want to support BLM. However, I cannot ignore my identity and the history of my  people to fully support a movement that unfortunately disregards the facts  related to Israel and the Jewish struggle, and thus perpetuates  anti-Semitism.I will always support the fight to end systematic racism,  and work hard to bring racial equity to this country and world, but it deeply  saddens me that I cannot wholeheartedly support the BLM movement any  longer.

<title>Grapevine: Double Ten</title>
<date>13/10/2016</date>
<content>
POPULARLY KNOWN as 10/10 or Double Ten in Taiwan, October 10 commemorates the  start of the Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, which led to the collapse of  the Qing Dynasty in China and establishment of the Republic of China on January  1, 1912.Last Monday, Yun-Sheng Chi, the Representative of the Taipei  Economic and Cultural Office in Tel Aviv, together with his wife hosted a Taiwan  National Day reception at the Sheraton Hotel in Tel Aviv, where a Chinese chef  contributed to the authenticity with Taiwanese cuisine.




There were more  guests than in years gone by, and they stayed for longer than usual.The  only thing that marred the occasion was that despite the elegance of the hotel  and the friendly efficiency of its service, its acoustics were  horrendous.A young Israeli woman, brought on to sing in Chinese and  Hebrew, made a valiant attempt to be heard over the rising crescendo of the  babble of the crowd.People standing right in front of her could barely  hear her. She put on a brave front and kept smiling throughout, but as soon as  she concluded her performance, she rushed off the stage in tears, and nothing  that her relatives or friends said could comfort her.One can imagine her  anticipation at performing at such an occasion, and the trauma that resulted  from the experience. The uncivilized behavior of guests at National Day  receptions is nothing new. A former Russian ambassador once yelled so loudly  into the microphone for guests to keep quiet that they fell into shocked  silence. A former Lithuanian ambassador would not allow food to be served until  all the formalities of the occasion had been completed.Guests knew that  if they didn’t behave themselves, they would go home hungry.Too often,  an ambassador hosting a function cannot be heard at his or her own residence,  let alone in a hotel or another public facility, because of the noise of the  crowd. It’s a pity that the OECD doesn’t give points for rudeness vs  politeness.If it did, Israel might be shamed into improving its  behavior. There was a wonderful video of the vibrant, multi-cultural,  multi-faith population of Taiwan and their achievements in culture, industry,  medicine, science and technology and humanitarian aid to other countries, but  unfortunately, hardly any of the guests stopped to watch it. Yet another facet  of rudeness coupled with an inexplicable lack of curiosity.For political  reasons, Israel does not have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and  therefore Foreign Ministry officials do not attend Taiwan events. However  retired Foreign Ministry and other former government officials have no  compunction about attending them, and at least three such people were present as  well as Ramat Gan Mayor Israel Singer, whose city has a twin city agreement with  Taiwan, former government minister Ran Cohen who is currently chairman of the  Israel Standards Institute and President of the Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce;  and Knesset members Nachman Shai and Nurit Koren, who are both members of the  Israel-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group of which Shai is the  chairman.In his address, Shai, despite the absence of full diplomatic  relations, referred to Yun-Sheng as “ambassador” as did most other people. Both  Shai and Yun-Sheng made their speeches in English, with Shai concluding that he  hoped that by next year that the ambassador would speak in Hebrew, and that he,  would speak in Chinese.Yung-Sheng said that he wanted to continue and  expand ties with the government and people of Israel and to encourage greater  cooperative ventures. Over the past year he said 10,000 Taiwanese had visited  Israel, and 6,000 Israelis had visited Taiwan. He is very keen to have more  Taiwanese people visit the Holy Land, he said, and implied that word of mouth  recommendations would result in more Israelis putting Taiwan on their travel  itineraries. “All Israeli visitors to Taiwan tell me they had the best time.”  Relating to Taiwan’s January 2016 elections in which Tsai Ing-wen became her  country’s first female president, Yun-Sheng said that there been a smooth  transition of power which had been an example of democracy in action.■  WOMEN Wage Peace is a political, non-partisan movement of Jewish and Arab women  some of whom have lost loved ones to war and terrorism. They came together with  a common purpose two years ago following Operation Protective Edge, and they are  marching to Jerusalem – and not just because Succot is a pilgrim festival on  which in ancient times, pilgrims brought their offerings to the Temple in  Jerusalem.On the evening of October 4 this year, Women Wage Peace  started out from the extreme north of the country to walk to the residence in  Jerusalem of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on their March of Hope, linking  up with marchers from different parts of the country along the way. The two-week  march is due to end on Wednesday, October 19. Barring any interference by  security authorities, some 1,000 Palestinian women from the West Bank together  with Liberian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Leymah Gbowee, who is the guest of  honor of Women Wage Peace, will join their Israeli counterparts.The  joint call for peace coupled with the demand that Israel reach a treaty with the  Palestinians so that Israeli and Palestinian children can grow up with a safe  and carefree childhood free of hatred and fear will be within close to the prime  minister’s residence, but not directly outside it.Ever since the  assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, the public has not been permitted  to congregate in either Balfour or Smolenskin streets which intersect at the  Prime Minister’s residence, and all demonstrations take place around the corner  in Paris Square, where the PM cannot necessarily see them.■ APROPOS  NETANYAHU, though looking somewhat unwell and perspiring profusely, he  nonetheless kept his pledge to attend the Kol Nidre service at Jerusalem’s Hazvi  Yisrael Congregation.Accompanied by his two sons, the PM stayed through  the whole service, and also delivered an address. “He’s a real trooper” said one  of the stalwarts of the congregation.President Reuven Rivlin had also  been scheduled to attend, but opted out and went to the Great Synagogue  instead.■ US AMBASSADOR Dan Shapiro is urging American citizens in  Israel to vote.His Facebook Page features him photographed alongside an  American flag and a poster that states: “Americans can vote wherever they are.”  Shapiro’s message reads: “You are eligible to vote by absentee ballot in this  year’s US elections. You must register to vote in your state of last residence,  and drop off your ballot to the US Embassy or mail it back to the US by October  20.”■ ALTHOUGH THERE are festivals all over Israel during the  intermediate days of Succot, it seems that at some stage or another during this  holiday period, that all roads lead to Jerusalem as they did in Temple  times.This applies to non-Jews as well as Jews.For several years  now, the International Christian Embassy has been hosting the Feast of  Tabernacles which brings thousands of Evangelicals from around the world to  Jerusalem, and it is also a co-sponsor of the Chairman’s Conference to be held  together with the World Jewish Congress and the Israel Allies Foundation during  the period of the Succot. This is the fifth consecutive year in which the  Chairman’s Conference will be held, and it will include 23 parliamentarians who  are also participating in the feast, which is being held in the capital’s Pais  Arena. The key theme of the Chairman’s Conference, taking place at the Mamilla  Hotel will be the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.MPs  attending the conference include: Bas Belder, who serves as the chairman of the  Israel Allies Caucus in the European Parliament and vice chairman of the  delegation for relations between the European Parliament and Israel; Italian  Senator Lucio Malan, who earlier this year initiated a bill prohibiting  Holocaust denial; Kees van der Staaij who proposed a bill in The Netherlands for  the prevention of funding of BDS organizations; and MP Kenneth Meshoe from South  Africa who strongly opposes the claim that Israel is an apartheid state. Other  MPs scheduled to attend the conference will come from Denmark, Finland, Latvia,  Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Greece, Portugal, Brazil,  Uruguay, Costa Rica, Chile and Malawi.The MPs will be greeted at  reception at the Mamilla hotel by Josh Reinstein of the IAF which coordinates  the activities of 35 pro-Israel caucuses in parliaments in the US, Europe, Latin  America, Africa, Asia and Australia, Jürgen Bühler, the executive director of  ICEJ and Lawrence Weinbaum representing the World Jewish Congress, whose  President Ronald Lauder is coming to Israel for the third time in a five-week  period in order to address the conference.
Within the framework of the  conference, participants will also visit Hebron as guests of the Council of  Jewish Communities of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. As far as is known,  this is the first time that so many parliamentarians from so many countries will  visit the Cave of the Patriarchs greerfc@gmail.com

<title>Here and There: The chosen people</title>
<date>11/2/2016</date>
<content>
Have you  ever wondered as to how the Bible depicts us, the Jewish people, as the “chosen  people?” Yes, we are a people and yes, we have our own national homeland –  something we achieved after 2,000 years of wandering – an Exile that proved to  be the antipathy of what we would have imagined the “chosen people” to mean. An  exile that saw the most horrific planned and carried through extermination of  six million of our brethren who were chosen to be murdered specifically because  they were Jews.Today we are in charge of our own destiny – we are  privileged to be the generation that has witnessed the rebirth of the State of  Israel in our time and yet, once again we the “chosen people” are chosen in the  most negative sense of the word.




How else can we describe the consistent  virulent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against the one Jewish  state? Of late we see repeated examples of this – whether throughout the  campuses worldwide where to be Jewish and to support Israel, against a barrage  of sophisticated, sponsored pro-Palestinian activity, is becoming something most  Jewish students steer clear of.A recent frightening example of the  challenges the Jewish student faces is the riot carried out by pro-Palestinians  – at the UK’s King’s College – who smashed windows, set off fire alarms during a  speech by Israel’s former Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) head Ami Ayalon.  This in itself is somewhat strange because Ayalon, together with Yossi Beilin,  was the author of the 2003 “Geneva Initiative” – a proposed Israeli-Palestinian  peace plan that, at the time, was favored more by the Palestinians than the  Israelis.However, the relevant question today is where were the King’s  College administrators that permitted this rioting to take place? On the same  day as I read a Jerusalem Post report on Ayalon’s ghastly experience I read an  article headed “British doctors seek to expel Israel from int’l body.” It  appears that 71 physicians (out of 200,000 members of the British Medical  Association) have petitioned “The World Medical Association” accusing “The  Israel Medical Association” (in compliance with Israeli doctors) of carrying out  torture against Palestinian prisoners. One of the signatories was that of the  Liberal Democrats peer Baroness Jenny Tonge, who resigned from the parliamentary  party in 2012 after being criticized by its then leader Nick Clegg for saying  “Israel is not going to be there forever.”In a recent letter, addressed  to Dr. Shimon Samuels of the Simon Wiesenthal Center – Europe, the president of  the WMA, Sir Michael Marmot (who is also concurrently the president of the BMA)  states, “The main authors of the letter [accusing Israel’s medical association  and its doctors of torture] have launched several attacks against the IMA with  similar arguments in the past. On each occasion, the WMA has asked the Israeli  Medical Association to respond. Investigations have revealed no wrong doing or  mishandling of the cases by the Israeli Medical Association.”The action  by the 71 UK doctors continue to target a single nation, they do not seek to  pursue other countries where there is clear and internationally recognized  evidence of torture. Some of the medical associations in these countries are  organs of the state and not independent professional associations like the  IMA.The campaign attacking the IMA not only accuses Israeli doctors of  medical torture but, in common with the essence of BDS, accuses the Israeli  medical system of operating in an apartheid manner. A lecture given by Prof.  David Katz (University College, London and chairman of the UK’s Jewish Medical  Association), noted that Israel is equated with the suspension of the Medical  Association of South Africa from the WMA during the 1980s. The boycott of South  African medicine contributed to the fall of apartheid in South Africa. It can  therefore be assumed that a boycott of Israeli medicine might well contribute  towards the fall of the “apartheid” State of Israel.Katz goes on to give  a personal example of how he was in Israel during Passover 2002 (at the time of  the bomb at the Seder in Netanya and of the “Battle of Jenin”) He and his family  made many visits to the Bnai Zion Hospital in Haifa where two elderly relatives  had been admitted. Here they shared their wards, room and communal facilities  with Israeli Arabs and/or Palestinian patients. The Katz family visited the  hospital on both the day before and the day after the suicide bomb that went off  in a Haifa restaurant. As a result the hospital became a front line accident and  emergency center – there was no difference discernible in patient, visitor and  carer relationships all were treated equally.This phenomenon operates up  until today.We know that the recent spate of stabbings and shootings  have brought both victim and terrorists to our Israeli hospitals – each is a  patient and given the same level of care. Simultaneously Israeli hospitals  continue to receive patients from the Gaza Strip as well as the Palestinian  territories.Israel’s medical system is not only limited to those who  live here. It is interesting to note that our hospitals are caring for those  caught up in the Syrian Civil War. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights, have been able to document the deaths of 230,618 Syrians including  almost 70,000 civilians of whom more than 7,000 are children. The Ziv Medical  Center, in Safed, has taken in well over 2,000 patients of whom 70-80 percent  are male combatants. The hospital’s maternity wing has cared for Syrian  expectant mothers who have given birth but care is taken not to name the country  of birth.Speaking recently with Katz, he explained the aims of the UK’s  Jewish Medical Association is to give support to British-Jewish medical  professionals as well as informing about Jewish and Israeli medical approaches  and achievements. Last year the association convened a European Medical Forum in  London at which Prof. David Stone, a distinguished British epidemiologist  spoke.Stone has monitored and rebutted anti- Israel material that has  appeared in the medical press. In his talk he said that the publication  represents a case study of the politicization of medicine. He gave examples of  articles that appeared in The Lancet.It is a matter of deep concern that  The Lancet (considered the most prestigious medical journal in the UK) has,  since 2009, become a purveyor of a distorted narrative of Israeli  culpability.Stone addressed the question: “Has Israel damaged  Palestinian health?” He produced data clearly refuting the suggestion that since  1967 Palestinians’ health had deteriorated. The reality is that since 1967  Israel and the Palestinian territories shared high birth rates, decreasing death  rates with a rise in life expectancy and net inward migration from other  countries. He gave data proving that, contrary to the accusation that Israel had  damaged Palestinian health, Israel had substantially improved Palestinian public  health. Yet despite the evidence anti-Israel rhetoric continues to obscure  reality, obstructs peace efforts and should be recognized as “politicized  medicine.”Katz strongly believes that the most productive way of  combating the persistent attempt to drive out the country’s representative  medical body from the world association is to bring to Israel eminent members of  Britain’s medical leadership to meet with their Israeli peers. This year Katz  will be bringing Lord Ara Darzi, who is professor of surgery at Imperial College  London, an authority on innovative medical technology and recently listed as one  of the 20 most influential people in British medicine.One can but hope  that bringing influential people here will change the increasing negative  perception of our country. The battle for truth is becoming more challenging  each day. It is high time that our government recognize the significance of  counteracting the distorted image of Israel that is projected worldwide. We have  won many military battles in the past but there is a real danger that we will  lose the battle of the word unless we invest more manpower and funding into  advocacy for Israel.We are ready to return to the biblical concept of  being the “chosen people” – one that can be a light unto the nations – rather  than be chosen internationally as the world’s “whipping boy.”

<title>Here and There: The US-Israel relationship – where is it headed?</title>
<date>9/3/2016</date>
<content>
The constant  anti-Israel bombardment is affecting Jewish students as well as others. These  past weeks have been dominated by the American presidential election.US  citizens choose a new president this year. I have to confess that I find myself  tuning in to Fox News more frequently than normal, despite the fact that every  few minutes it leaves the news and goes into the irritating “Fox Extra” mode.  However, I do seem to be caught up in the excitement and anxiety of seeing which  candidates will finally face off against each other in November.




As the  US is Israel’s strongest ally, many Israelis view with concern which candidate  will be in the driving seat by the end of this year. At a time when many  countries seem to be turning away from Israel, the strength of the US-Israel  relationship takes on even greater significance. To what extent will this  relationship remain intact, given increasing worldwide pressure to isolate the  only Jewish state? One of the most worrying articles I have read recently is by  Haaretz columnist Ari Shavit. Having visited some 40 American universities this  past year, giving lectures to thousands of students, he was shocked at the  devastating inroads the BDS movement had made among far too many students –  Jewish as well as others. He described conversations with Jewish students as  heartbreaking – showing a clear turning away from Israel.This year marks  the 12th annual Israel Apartheid Week. The first Apartheid Week was held in  Toronto in 2005. Today the IAW website boasts of 155 universities worldwide  hosting this event.As Columbia University’s “Apartheid Week” was set to  begin in New York, a Canary Mission report profiled 39 of the university’s major  campus anti-Israel activists over the past several years, students and  professors, many belonging to Students for Justice for Palestine and Jewish  Voice for Peace. One professor profiled is Joseph Massad, professor of modern  Arab politics and intellectual history. The mission documents his ongoing  anti-Israel research and teaching, considered one of the most anti-Jewish  screeds in recent history. Last year The Algemeiner reported that Columbia  topped a list of universities “with the most anti-Semitic activity.”On  March 1, Israeli-born Ilan Pappe, a “new historian” known for his anti-Israel  pro-Palestinian stance, addressed students at America’s prestigious Yale  University under the umbrella of Students for Justice for Palestine. The lecture  was titled “Why is Palestine still the issue in 2016?” The $5 entry fee was “a  suggested donation” to be used to fund Pappe’s trip to the States. Born in Haifa  to parents who escaped from Germany in the ’30s, Pappe lectured for years at the  University of Haifa. He was asked to resign when he called for the boycott of  Israeli universities. Currently, he is a professor at the University of Exeter  in the UK.On the first day of the United Kingdom’s Israel Apartheid  Week, February 22, London commuters came face-toface with official-looking  advertisements depicting Israel as an apartheid state – displayed in over 500  tube trains reaching four million passengers. The fact that Transport for London  removed them does not take away from the reality that the damage had already  been done.At Oxford University, Alex Chalmers, co-chair of the Oxford  University Labor Club, resigned because of the decision to endorse Israel  Apartheid Week 2016.On Facebook, Chalmers accused members of the club’s  executive of “throwing around the term ‘Zio’” (a term for Jews usually confined  to websites run by the Ku Klux Klan), stressing that anti- Israel feeling and  anti-Zionism have become mechanisms for expressing  anti-Semitism.Speakers invited to past Oxford IAWs have included Omar  Barghouti. Born in Qatar, brought up in Egypt and now living in Jaffa, he holds  a master’s degree in philosophy from Tel Aviv University and is studying there  for his doctorate.He is the co-founder of the BDS Movement and a  founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural  Boycott of Israel. While 184,000 signed a petition demanding his expulsion from  Tel Aviv University, the petition was rejected.Another speaker was Avi  Shilam, who once lived in Israel and has dual Israeli and British citizenship. A  virulent verbal and written critic of Israel, he married the great-granddaughter  of David Lloyd George – British prime minister at the time of the Balfour  Declaration.A regular contributor to The Guardian, he accuses Zionism of  being the “real enemy” of the Jews. Clearly, one who holds Israeli citizenship  becomes an even more powerful advocate against the State of Israel.What  is happening on campuses today worldwide concerns us all. The link to the  American 2016 election campaign is clear. It is from universities that  tomorrow’s leaders will emerge. While there is a sense that, for the coming year  or so, Israel will continue to enjoy support from the US, we should be deeply  concerned about what the future will bring. The constant anti-Israel bombardment  is affecting Jewish students as well as others. Jewish undergraduates  overwhelmed with sophisticated anti-Israel campaigns waged virtually on a daily  basis are totally unprepared from an informed and educated point of view. If one  doesn’t know the facts, it is all too easy to take on the ferocious stream of  negativity aimed at Israel.Last month a “secret” gathering took place in  Jerusalem under Strategic Affairs Minister, Gilad Erdan with 150 participants  from 20 countries. The subject was how to deal with BDS. Because of the secrecy  it is difficult to know whether the question of what is happening on campuses  today was discussed at any meaningful level. This is an urgent matter to be  dealt with now or there will be no one to invite to such “secret” gatherings  tomorrow.These past weeks have highlighted the US presidential campaign  as well as the 2016 Oscar award ceremony. Among the winners was the Hungarian  film Son of Saul. I saw it, and it shook me to the core – a film on the Nazi  concentration camps that left nothing to the imagination, a graphically painful  portrayal of how Germans treated human beings.The Holocaust was  something that happened in my lifetime, but for university students it is  history.This film should be shown on every campus throughout the world.  It might go a long way toward understanding where we come from and why we have  managed to build a beautiful country whose gates remain open to every Jew.

<title>How Israel will win the public diplomacy war</title>
<date>3/3/2016</date>
<content>
It is rare for a newspaper column to read as a “how to” manual. But in this  case, I have no choice – frustration has reached an all-time high.We  know that if Israel laid down its arms it would be destroyed, while if Hamas  would drop its arms, and the Palestinian Authority would stop the incitement,  there would be peace in Israel. We know that Israel is the only true democracy  in the Middle East, and the only country in the region that provides equal  rights for all people regardless of gender, race, religion or sexual  orientation.




And yet, despite this, data presented to me at a recent  meeting with one of the top polling companies in the United States shows that we  are failing to convey this reality.In the poll conducted just two weeks  ago, only 39 percent of US college students said that they believe that Israel  is a civilized, Western country; only 31% of them believe Israel is a democratic  country; and as a result of not telling our story properly, a mere 28% of  college students believe that the United States should side with Israel in the  current conflict.This is an all-time low.But it gets worse: 21%  believe that the US should side with the Palestinians! Furthermore, among a  category of people labeled as “opinion elite” in the US, 38% believe that Israel  is a racist country, 48% say that Israel is responsible for human rights abuses,  and 45% believe Israel is practicing apartheid on Palestinian land.Only  67% of those “opinion elite” in the US believe that Israel wants peace with its  neighbors. (In Canada that number drops to 43% and in the United Kingdom it’s  36%); 46% believe that Israeli “occupation” results in more terrorism in the US;  and 19% believe that boycotts against Israel are justified.And finally,  given all of the above, it is not surprising to learn that 17% of Jewish college  students refuse to advocate for Israel.We have to face facts: current  hasbara tactics are not working, and we must be mature and sophisticated enough  to accept a new approach.That same pollster checked to see what makes  people supportive of a country. So far we have been bombarding the world touting  Israel’s groundbreaking technology. We have tried to win support by promoting  the Start-up Nation with its drip irrigation, solar energy and cellular phone  technology, and Waze.But that isn’t working, and the data make clear  why: only 7% are drawn to support a country because it is “modern,” a mere 6%  are impressed if a country is “innovative,” and a country which is “creative”  means something special to just 4%.Clearly, our message to the world in  our effort to fight delegitimization should not focus on Israeli technology and  innovation.All of the polling data – and, frankly, common sense –  indicate that our message cannot be “We are right, they are wrong,” or, “We are  good and they are bad,” no matter how strongly we believe this to be the  case.So, what do people want to hear about another country? Here again  the data is clear: 60% are willing to support a country that “protects human  rights,” 42% will rally behind a country that stands for “freedom,” 32% want to  see that a country is democratic, and 30% want to know that a country promotes  equality.We must learn from this and speak the language which can  penetrate the hearts and minds of those who are not on our side, and who are  prone to fall for the boycott approach.What is that specific language?  The same pollster found that certain phrases and sentences must be used over and  over again in our effort to gain support, or, at at the very least, to even the  playing field: 1) We must stop talking about “anti-Semitism” and focus on  “anti-Israel.”2) We must emphasize that we are “eager” for dialogue at  all times.3) We must be clear that our struggle is with the Palestinian  leadership and not with the Palestinian people.4) We must repeat that  the issue is “human rights for everyone,” a “future without violence” in the  region, and that we advocate “mutual respect.”Once we speak that  language, according to the research, we can then focus on the following themes  which resonate among those who are currently sympathetic to the Palestinian  cause: 1) Accountability and corruption.Where did all the money go?  Billions of dollars from the international community have been sent to the Hamas  leadership in Gaza, money that they used to fund terrorist attacks against  innocent civilians and to construct terrorist tunnels into Israel, instead of to  build schools and hospitals.2) Hatred is not natural. It is  taught.Palestinian children are being educated that killing Jews  fulfills religious teachings; Palestinian children are taught to see violence  against Israelis as heroic. (I must emphasize that the polling data indicate  that we should focus on these specific aspects of Palestinian incitement, and  not on schools and public squares being named after terrorists, or that Jews are  called “barbaric monkeys” and “evil” in the Palestinian media.) 3) We must  repeatedly quote the Hamas Charter, and specifically these lines: a) “The hour  of judgment shall not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them.” b)  “There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad.” c) “Peace  initiatives, so-called peaceful solutions and the international conferences to  resolve the Palestinian problem are all contrary to the beliefs of the Islamic  Resistance Movement.”Weaving this all together, our overall message  should be clear: “For far too long, Palestinians have been trapped in a cycle of  violence and despair. Their schools have been taught to teach  violence.Their leaders have been quick to preach violence. We do not  blame the people of Gaza for their feelings of grief, anger and desperation. We  blame the Hamas leadership which sows the seeds of hate, and tells innocent  civilians to live as human shields while hiding in tunnels paid for by the  international community.”Two final effective and critical sentences: 1)  “Children should be taught to live and love, not to die.”2) “Our rockets  protect our children.Their children protect their  rockets.”Finally, aside from this precise messaging about the overall  conflict, we must confront the issue of boycotts head-on, using the following  two points which the polls demonstrate have the greatest impact: 1) The BDS  movement does not explicitly recognize Israel’s right to exist.2) The  BDS movement encourages Iran’s terrorist surrogates such as Hamas and Hezbollah  to continue to work toward the destruction of Israel.Once we make these  points, the language that works best to combat suggestions of boycotts reads: 1)  “Peace is paved with diplomacy and discussion, not isolation.”2) “We  seek cooperation, not continued conflict.”3) “Solutions come from  engagement, not silence.”4) “We need real solutions for a lasting peace,  not more of the divisive rhetoric. Let’s work together to create understanding,  respect and peace.”5) “Boycotts divide people, and that’s part of the  problem – not a solution.”6) “Boycott, divestment and sanctions diminish  the prospect for peace because they blame only one side. We need a meaningful  commitment on both sides.”We are at war. The other side is efficient and  stays on message, and we need to do the same. It is my hope that all those  involved in Israel advocacy and public diplomacy will adhere to the messages  which the polling data begs us to follow. If we do, I have no doubt that we will  win the public diplomacy war and generate widespread support for our beloved  Israel.

<title>How to lose friends and irritate people</title>
<date>12/4/2016</date>
<content>
The sweet 18-year-old on the plane,  idealistic but a bit scared, who was volunteering for the IDF. The Iraqi woman  in the laundrette who invited me to Friday night dinner. The young man in the  second-hand bookshop, who asked me to read to him out loud from David  Copperfield so that he can hear Dickens in an English accent.However, in  leaving behind my old life to make aliya, I am finding that you lose some  friends as well. Since arriving in Israel, I have been “de-friended” by four  people on Facebook, and I have had what you might call “warnings” from  others.




Even before I left the UK, there were the funny  remarks.The assumption was always that “something” had happened to me. I  had “changed,” and not in a good way. I’d be back when I saw something called  “The Truth.”Nice, liberal, public-sector- working Jews, are not supposed  to like Israel. Or, at least, things are OK as you don’t talk about  it.Others, I have noticed, face no such inhibition. As I hope to show in  what follows, it is perfectly acceptable to throw the most outrageous  accusations around about Israel, but if you reply, then you are the evil  racist.Here is a sample of what has crossed my Facebook page,  unsolicited, but posted by friends and online acquaintances.An image,  headlined “Zionism: The True Face of Israel!” of a demonic dog draped in a  sheep’s fleece. Another depicting a dagger in the shape of the country, being  stabbed into the chest of a child by an Israeli soldier.Israel has  killed “one million children,” writes a Turkish man living in London. It has  committed “mass murder,” writes a woman from Australia.An activist of  the center-left Liberal Democrat Party in the UK squeezes all the left-wing buzz  words into a single post: “apartheid,” “Zionist Israeli lobby,” “far-right  Netanyahu Israeli government,” “ethnic cleansing,” “Israeli lobby dosh,”  “horrific war-crimes,” “inhumane Warsaw-like ghetto of Gaza,” and for good  measure: “the new Wall...reminiscent of the wall around the Warsaw Ghetto.” He  signs off “peace love respect” [sic].Now, all of this is socially  acceptable talk from liberals and leftists. Responding is not.When I  respond to counter these claims, four things happen. First, I am accused  of racism and betrayal.One friend writes: “You someone who I have always  respected and admired I feel like you have changed into something u would have  never dreamt” [sic].This is from an old school friend: “I have been  really sad to read so much anger and hatred in your Facebook  feed.”Another Liberal Democrat activist (I will call him Liberal  Democrat Activist 2) writes: “You and I used to be political allies. Which is  why I don’t understand why you have turned into an apologist for a racist,  far-Right government.”Later, he complains: “you make no attempt to  disengage yourself from Netanyahu’s mob.”In other words, Jews have to  prove their right to take part in the debate, by declaring that they are one of  the “good Jews.”LDA 2 goes on to call me a racist several times,  specifically: “You appear to have turned into a racist liar. Enjoy your time  supporting your racist mates. Bye.” “I do not know why [you have] turned  into such a twisted and poisonous individual... evidently [you have] been  captured by the forces of racism.”“You were once an honourable person  and have become a lying racist bigot.”Second, within a very few posts in  any discussion on Israel, the real anti-Semitism starts.A woman from  Cardiff, Wales writes to me as follows: “A great deal of history tells us that  most countries where Jews have congregated eventually they have been expelled by  the indigenous population [sic]. We have to ask ourselves why.”LDA 2  writes: “Go to the Sea” [sic]. He gets angry when I remind him of the origins of  that phrase, amends it to “Buzz off,” then deletes the post  completely. Then he blocks me.Third, people start wishing you  actual harm.I remonstrate with two Pakistani men and an Australian woman  over a story claiming that a pork chop was placed on the face of a dying  Palestinian man. I suggest that it is perverse to focus on this unlikely (who  has a pork chop to hand in Israel?) aspect of the story while ignoring the fact  that the “dying man” is one of a wave of knife attack terrorists targeting  Israeli soldiers, police and civilians.One of the Pakistani men calls  Israel “that ugly country” populated by “murderers and land-grabbers.” “Maybe  you could learn to share with those who have had the land before 1948 & have  been displaced by people like you,” an Australian woman throws in, adding: “If  one corners a wounded animal one should not be surprised if one gets bitten.  Enjoy your new country.”My Australian correspondent relishes what she  reads as my “fear” at the prospect of “getting bitten,” i.e. stabbed, shot, or  run over in a vehicular attack. Enjoy! Fourth, and quite early on, I am told  something like: “I have no wish to discuss this with you,” even when the person  saying this started the conversation in the first place.It is painful to  watch parties I once voted for – the center-left Labor and the Liberal Democrat  Parties in the UK – overtaken by ideas and a language that would be unacceptable  if used about any other country or national group. Imagine refusing to speak to  a Pakistani before he first declares his hostility to the Pakistani  government.Or describing China as an “ugly country populated by  murderers and land-grabbers.”It is more painful still when friends no  longer take your humanitarianism for granted based on their knowledge of you as  a person, but assume that you have been “captured” by a sinister force when you  begin to explore and express an intrinsic part of your identity.Zionism  says that there should be one small country in the world that really wants us. A  country where we can live as of right, and not on sufferance.Perhaps the  discourse on Israel/ Palestine is the greatest proof of all that this idea still  matters.

<title>Right from Wrong: Ignorance- The true cost of higher education</title>
<date>6/3/2016</date>
<content>
During several sleepless nights, watching loops of 24-hour news broadcasts  devoted to the US presidential race, I noticed certain themes that otherwise  might have escaped my attention. One was the claim that first-time voters are  “too young to remember” the scandals surrounding former president Bill Clinton  and wife Hillary’s behavior during the period that the couple occupied the White  House.This assertion was like a hidden key to unlocking another  phenomenon related to Americans in the age group under discussion and the  surrounding culture’s attitude toward them. I am talking about the latest  “radical chic” on campuses across the country – feverpitched anti-Israel  activism.




At both Ivy League and state schools, accusing the Jewish state  of war crimes against the “oppressed Palestinian people” is the current ticket  to peer acceptance.Campaigning for boycott, divestment and sanctions  against “Israeli apartheid” is so popular that anything from complaints about  high tuition and student loans to criticism of professors and guest lecturers  has become part and parcel of the movement.The response of university  administrators and faculty has been to cower and hold meetings with student-  body representatives to discuss free speech. So rampant has this scenario become  that alumni are starting to wake up and take measures, among them threats to  cease donating money to their alma maters.Meanwhile, parents of the kids  spending what should be valuable time at institutions of higher learning by  planning rallies, creating installations of mock Israeli checkpoints and  denouncing dissenting views continue to fork out exorbitant sums of money for  degrees that won’t even land most of their children proper jobs.Parents  of the kids who feel threatened or outcast for supporting Israel – and even find  swastikas and Hitler graffiti in their dorms – also dole out the tens of  thousands of dollars it costs for the privilege of graduating from a name-brand  school.Reports of this worrisome trend bring me back to my own college  days in the 1970s. Past the Vietnam War-era sit-ins of the draft-dodging  hippies, and after the Yom Kippur War that devastated Israel, I happened to hit  a period of less hysteria on campus. Still, at the University of Chicago, like  everywhere else, students with causes handed out leaflets and attended  demonstrations of one sort or another. These usually focused on feminism and gay  rights. There might have been some pro-Israel students who lived together in  kosher houses. But I was never involved in any of it.One reason for my  lack of participation was that I found ideologues to be as tiresome as they were  humorless, even though I held strong political positions I was not ashamed to  verbalize, in spite of their unpopularity.Another, far more pressing  cause for my shunning any such activity was homework – endless, mind-boggling,  terrifying assignments with looming deadlines from teachers not prone to giving  good grades.The self-disciplined students I knew were a source of deep  envy. They were the ones who didn’t wait until the last minute to write their  papers or study for exams.They spent hours in between and after classes  at the library, only rewarding themselves with a beer or a movie when they had  completed their own quota to satisfaction.The rest of us used beer and  movies to avoid facing the reams of material that instilled the worst kind of  terror in our guts – the fear of failure. It had been made clear to us upon our  arrival that this was not going to be anything like high school. The message was  that we may have been accepted to the illustrious college by the grace of God,  SAT scores, teacher recommendations, personal essays and interviews, but now  that we were here there would be no resting on our laurels. We were going to  have to prove ourselves worthy through the work we produced.One  professor returned the first papers we all submitted – without having read them  – for exceeding the number of typed pages he had specified and ignoring the rule  of a single space after a comma and a double space after a period. These were  the days before computers, when we banged out our words on manual (or electric,  if we were lucky) typewriters, using carbon paper for copies and white-out on  mistakes. Having homework returned for being typed unsatisfactorily meant having  to start over from scratch. We were incensed, but nobody was around to comfort  us for having been dealt such an unjust blow.I do not need to question  how these kids today have the time or energy to be battling Israel while trying  to complete a university degree. Judging by illiteracy evident in their blogs,  articles for college publications and posts on social media, the answer is there  in black and white. If they have any homework at all, either they aren’t doing  it, or their teachers (whose own ability to produce a comprehensible,  grammatically correct and properly punctuated sentence is dubious, at best) are  grading them on their politics, not their knowledge.One does not need an  education to be eligible to vote in a democracy. But it is extremely telling  that the “best and brightest” – those whose formal educations provide them a  mantle of respectability – are not expected to be versed in anything that  happened before their time. Indeed, if they are “too young to remember” the  White House of the Clintons, both of whom are still alive, one shudders to  imagine their approach to George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.Why is it  not taken for granted that they should be reading about these matters? The  answer, alas, is that though these students have everything at their fingertips,  including electronic devices with all the world’s information available at the  tap of a button, no demands are made of them, least of all intellectual  ones.Ignorance is not bliss. But it certainly has become an expensive  commodity.The writer is the web editor of The Algemeiner  (algemeiner.

<title>In plain language: The blame game</title>
<date>18/8/2016</date>
<content>
‘Black Lives Matter,” so they say. But apparently, black integrity, black  honesty or black knowledge of geopolitical affairs doesn’t matter all that much.  At least that’s the conclusion one would have to draw from the recent visit of  these foreign troublemakers, who came to Israel to meet in solidarity with their  Palestinian “brothers” and trash the “apartheid-loving” Jews. (Tell me, please,  why is it that our government refused to allow the Beatles into the country in  1965, yet these lowlifes march in like they own the place?!) Never mind that  Jews have a long history of supporting civil rights, even when it wasn’t  fashionable. Never mind that we marched hand-in-hand with Blacks on countless  freedom marches.Never mind that the quintessential voice of Black pride,  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke out strenuously in praise of Zionism and the  Jewish state, or that Muslims have treated Blacks as slaves and infidels for  centuries.




None of that matters a whit – it’s now the “in thing” to  accuse Jews and Israelis of every crime imaginable, and place at our feet every  conceivable ill of society.Yet in a way, I understand completely why  these “activists” – ooh, that’s such a soft and sanitized euphemism, isn’t it? –  have found a kindred spirit in the “poor Palestinians”: both are truly  proficient at playing the blame game.YOU KNOW how that works, don’t you?  You ignore all your fault and foibles, you deny all your sins and  shortcomings.Instead, you blame “the other.” Anything negative that has  occurred in your life – be it poverty, displacement, poor quality of life, or  lack of political power – has nothing to do with you at all. It’s the other guy  who made this happen, the other guy who put you in this dismal state of affairs,  and who keeps you trapped there. And – what a surprise – the “other guy” usually  turns out be the Jew, or his alter ego, the Israeli.I have heard pundits  sometimes proclaim that “the Palestinians are the Jews of the Arab world.”  Nothing could be further from the truth. What a world of difference there is  between those woeful whiners and the Jewish People. We Jews have suffered  countless more misfortune and indignities – I could name at least six million  off the bat – than anything the Blacks or the Palestinians have ever faced. We  have been the illegitimate targets of every racist, religious fanatic and evil  regime in history. We, truly, have the right to blame a cruel world for the  tragedies we endured.But we consistently refused to go that route. We  understood that blaming someone else for your problems – even when justified –  only bogs you down in bitterness and recrimination and retards your forward  progress, for jealousy and self-pity soak up potential like a sponge. Instead,  we wiped away our tears and started over again, determined to make tomorrow  better than today.Even when half our population was cruelly wiped out in  less than a decade, we did not give up nor overly dwell on our loss. We rolled  up our sleeves and turned our sights on the future, and that is why Jews have  excelled everywhere in the post-Holocaust Diaspora, and why, against all odds,  we have built this amazing state that is one of the planet’s premier  nations.Just consider how Israel interfaces with the world at large. We  have excellent relations with Russia, which tormented our people for more than a  century in a vicious but vain campaign against Judaism, and then against  Zionism. We are on good terms with France, despite its long history of  anti-Semitism and its collaboration with the Nazis; and with England, which  twice expelled the Jews from its land and brutalized us during the Mandate. Even  Germany – just the word itself is hard to utter – is among our best friends and  supporters in the European Union. Yes, we could have turned our nose up at all  these countries and shunned them, in justified response to their past crimes  against us.But we decided it was more important to build than to  blame.THIS PAST week, we commemorated the fast of the Ninth of Av, the  saddest day in our calendar, marking the two exiles from our land and the  burning of our Holy Temples. The Talmud lists more than a dozen reasons why  these calamities occurred: We neglected to observe the Shabbat; we lacked  respect for our elders; we neglected the education of our youth; we acted with  violence or hatred towards our fellow Jew, etc. All of these diverse reasons  have one thing in common: they are things that we ourselves did wrong, not  something which others did to us.Were you to ask an outsider why Israel  was targeted, he would no doubt give you what would seem to be the obvious,  logical answer: The Babylonians and the Romans insisted we be subservient, and  so when we declared our independence and revolted against them, they were forced  to crush the rebellion and make an example of us. But that, the Talmud makes  clear, is one reason that doesn’t make the list. The rabbis, in their succinct  style, inform us that “the enemy was simply grinding already-ground flour.” In  other words, we, by our own actions or inactions, sealed our own fate. The  Babylonians and the Romans were merely instruments of God’s will.Every  good parent knows that when a child gets lazy or incorrigible, and shirks his  rightful duties, he may require a good “kick in the pants” to put him back on  the right path. What the Palestinians and their misguided supporters need is not  to be coddled, or have their persecution complex pampered and  praised.What they need is a strong kick in the tuches by the world  community, and told flat out that instead of blaming everyone else for their  perceived suffering, they should stop their bellyaching and make something out  of themselves.

<title>Israel & America: Changing at the United Nations?</title>
<date>28/1/2016</date>
<content>
It wasn’t too long ago when Israel had a reliable friend at the United Nations. The United States, a permanent member of the Security Council, helped keep enemies at bay and veto hateful resolutions against the Jewish State. But that might not be the case today, and Israel’s battles have become somewhat more solitary than they once were. Beginning last November the European Commission—the EU's executive arm—decided that products from the territories obtained as a result of the 1967 Six-Day War can no longer be sold in the 28-country EU as having come from Israel. They must be labeled as being from an occupied area.  




In late January at the United Nations, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon referred to Jewish towns and cities in Judea and Samaria as "provocative acts" and doubted Israel’s commitment to peace.  "As oppressed peoples have demonstrated throughout the ages, it is human nature to react to occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and extremism," he said, essentially blaming Israel for the months-long spate of stabbings, car-ramming and shooting of pregnant women, children and the elderly citizens of Israel.Prime Minister Netanyahu retorted angrily that Ban Ki-moon’s comments, "Give a tailwind to terrorism."The United Nations opposing Israel is not surprising – nor is the usual rancor in the hall of nations in which Israel is routinely vilified and sanctioned with more resolutions raised and passed than any other issue or nation.Yet, the one blow that is surprising is that the United States is joining the bandwagon and issued an unusually stern criticism of Israel.  President Obama is continuing his legacy, by suggesting that Israel will not have its friend anymore if it does not do exactly what the president wants.Contributing to this American aggression is the steady work during the past decade of so called leftist humanitarian groups—such as the American charity The New Israel Fund (NIF) and its hoard of grantees like Rabbis for Human Rights, B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence, Adalah, HaMoked and others, to name a few— who have paved the way for this very point in time.NIF has been clamoring against the State of Israel , and has established itself as a funder of just about any group that has an axe to grind against Israel.  Whether it is Adalah promoting lawfare, B’Tselem promoting Israel as an apartheid state, HaMoked providing flawed and erroneous data toward the damaging and now debunked Goldstone report, and a host of other nonconstructive, even wounding ventures, NIF has been at the center.While claiming to be against boycotts of Israel, NIF has provided plenty of fuel for the Boycott Divest Sanctions (BDS) fire that has been burning hotter lately.  For example, Alon Liel, Israel’s former ambassador to South Africa, is a member of two organizations which receive large funding by NIF: Ir Amin, which works against Jewish interests in Jerusalem, and B’Tselem.Ambassador Liel supports a cultural boycott of Israel and is a co-organizer of the campaign to call on European countries to undermine Israeli sovereignty by “recognizing” the “State of Palestine.” His wife is Rachel Liel, Israel director of the NIF.NIF’s supporters are a steady stream of American leftists “Jewish leaders” who believe that these methods of shaming Israel and its people is helpful. Philanthropists, including UJA-Federation President Alisa Doctoroff; President of the Jewish Communal Fund and JCRC Board member, Karen R. Adler; David Hochberg, Carole and Saul Zabar, Temple Israel of White Plains and others, have made it so that President Obama receives legitimacy from the Jewish community while openly opposing Israel and see it delegitimized on an international level.It matters not that some of these very groups were recently exposed for being part of a scheme to kill Palestinians who sold land to Jews.  When “humanitarian” Ezra Nawi was caught on record bragging about his role in the demise of Palestinian land owners and later arrested for it, the fact that he was on the payroll of Rabbis for Human Rights and getting money from Breaking the Silence did not jolt NIF’s supporters.  Neither did the actions of Nawi’s partner in crime, a B'Tselem worker named Nasser Nawaj'ah, who was also implicated.The truth falls on deaf ears and the damage they have done for years is having the impact they so desperately want.There is no one calling out Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas when he proclaims, “If there is an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, we won’t agree to the presence of one [Jew] in it” – yet the world claims Israel is promoting apartheid. That is the New Israel Fund doing its job.The past several months have been difficult on Israeli citizens, as terrorists run amok stabbing and shooting people at random. Abbas calls these people “heroic,” and Ban Ki-Moon suggests it is Israel’s fault, while the leftist NGOs and their supporters continue to harangue Israel endlessly.At the very least, those of us who stand with Israel must continue to insist that the New Israel Fund and their funders and leaders be considered non kosher.

<title>Israel and imperialism: The big lie</title>
<date>6/9/2016</date>
<content>
Eight years ago I presented an essay in these pages titled “The Myth of Zionist  Imperialism.” In the essay, I argued that from its earliest manifestation, the  modern Zionist movement was rabidly opposed to the rule of empire and,  therefore, it was absurd to paint a portrait of a Jewish state as being  “imperialist.”While the essay was well received – as was a later essay  on how England reneged on the promises of the Balfour Declaration – the time has  come to revisit this contentious issue.




On campuses throughout the world,  including here in the US, Israel is accused by the Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions (BDS) movement and its supporters that the Jews – white Europeans –  who settled in Israel before the founding of the state stole the land of the  indigenous Palestinians and that Israel was born in the “original sin” of  genocide. This argument is absurd and not based on fact. It is a prime example  of a reality of intellectual life on Western campuses: the prostitution of  scholarship to political ideology.I do not write these words as Jew or a  Zionist but as a student of history. This distortion of history is pervasive in  the West and in the Arab and Islamic world and must be challenged. Not to do so  is tantamount to cowardice and feeds into the Orwellian world of modern  scholarship.First, the context of the earliest Zionist thinkers and  their texts was a world in which Europeans challenged the rule of empires. Rabbi  Yehudah Alkalai, one of the earliest modern Zionist thinkers and activists,  although he couched his rhetoric of the Jews’ return to Israel in the  traditional messianic idea, was no doubt inspired by the rebellions of the  Greeks and the Serbs against the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Of Sephardi origin,  Alkalai served as rabbi in the capital of Serbia – the anti-imperial movements  of the mid-19th century moved him to call for Jewish sovereignty in the Land of  Israel. The same goes for Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, an Ashekanzi rabbi born in the  part of Poland acquired by Prussia in partition. Twice the Poles under control  of the Russian Empire rebelled against the Czars. Like Alkalai, Kalischer called  for Jews to return to sovereignty in the Land of Israel in the traditional  language of the messianic idea. At the same time, writing in 1862, he urged the  Jews “to take to heart the examples of the Italians, Poles, and Hungarians” and  fight for national independence. While Moses Hess was a Communist and a far cry  from the traditions of rabbis Alkalai and Kalischer, this colleague of Marx  argued in his prophetic tract Rome and Jerusalem that Jews fight empires in the  spirit of Garibaldi and Mazzini in an independent, modern, democratic Jewish  state. The origins of the Jewish state lie in rebellions against oppressive  empires.Second, although Theodor Herzl was the founder of Political  Zionism and the dynamo who put the movement on the global map, his attempts to  negotiate with great powers to recognize a Jewish state were a  failure.The Sultan of Turkey, Kaiser Wilhelm, the king of Italy and pope  Pius X – they rejected Herzl. The reality of Jewish labor and sovereignty in the  land of Israel was the work of idealistic young people who sacrificed everything  to work the land and build cities and towns.Great powers did not build  Israel and were not responsible for the creation of the kibbutz movement or of  the founding of Tel Aviv in 1909. Herzl’s appeals to great powers were a  colossal failure. The creation of the State of Israel was accomplished through  blood, sweat and tears – not treaties and declarations. To compare young Jews  like David Ben-Gurion, escaping poverty and pogroms in the Russian Pale of  Settlement, to the French in Algeria and the British in India is  absurd.The Jewish settlement of Eretz Yisrael was not the work of  foreigners who exploited the native population to amass great wealth and assume  “the white man’s burden.” The immigrants of the Second Aliya proved themselves  and their work through their own toil: “Hebrew labor.” They were Jews returning  to their people’s point of origin in history, religion and  culture.Third, the Balfour Declaration, celebrated in its own day and  today as the first acceptance by European powers of a modern Jewish homeland in  what was called Palestine, was a sham that ended up betraying the Jewish people  not long after the ink dried on the document. The product of both Christian  Zionism and the practical and tactical goal to draw more allies into the fight  against Germany, it was a failure due to the British fear of alienating the  Arabs of the Middle East. The British choice of rabid Jew hater Haj Amin  al-Husseini as mufti of Jerusalem – he later went on to collaborate with the  Nazis – and the limitations on Jewish immigration to Eretz Yisrael culminating  in the White Paper of 1939 made a mockery of this recognition of a “homeland,”  not even a sovereign Jewish state. The promise of the Balfour Declaration of  1917 was betrayed by the British.If this is the “imperialism” that  helped found the modern State of Israel, then the word “imperialism” is a  meaningless one, thrown around by professors, post-Zionists and anti-Israel  activists to delegitimize a Jewish nation that has every right to exist and has  proven its worth to the world.Fourth, Jews were never “white Europeans.”  If you think that the emancipation of Jews in the West was a neutral granting of  basic freedoms – including freedom of religion – think again. From Voltaire to  Adams to Jefferson, the bargain of civic equality was an abandonment of Jewish  “superstition” and the “tribal” and “cruel” God of Israel. John Adams supported  a Jewish state in Israel for one reason: so the Jews would “wear away some of  the asperities and peculiarities of their character and in time become liberal  Unitarian Christians for your Jehovah is our Jehovah and your God of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob is our God.”The attitude of the emancipators in the West  differed little from the attitude of colonialists to people of color in the  areas they controlled. The Jews lived as a people apart out of both desire to do  so and as a result of being persecuted – but up until modernity they were never  “Europeans.” They were simply Jews living autonomously among a non-Jewish  majority. The condescension of the colonial powers toward Arabs, Asians and  Africans is little different than the bargain of Emancipation. Jews were  expected to see the light and abandon their inferior culture. Napoleon, only 15  years after the granting of civic equality to Jews in France, suspected that  Jews were disloyal to their new motherland because they did not marry  Christians, and he still believed they made their fortunes from money lending.  Thomas Jefferson, for all his idealism regarding freedom of religion in America,  believed that Jesus arrived on the scene to correct the tribalism and cruelty of  the God of Israel and to correct the “mummeries” promoted by Moses.As I  have written in these pages before, there is not much distance between  Emancipation and Colonialism.The Jew was not the “white European” who  exploited “people of color.” The Jews’ identity was torn into shreds by  Enlightened Christians who denied the Jews’ national history and expected them  to conform to the majority. Jews understand too well the white man’s burden.  When the Emancipation project failed in Europe, the Nazis and their  collaborators murdered 5.8 million Jews precisely because they were not  “superior” white European Aryans. Jews were murdered because they were  Jews.
Zionism was not the result of imperialism and colonialism but a  response against it. Whether the struggle was against European empires or  Islamic empires, the Jews were inspired by their predecessors who fought for  freedom from subjugation. But forget about younger generations learning this  truth on campus. In this world of Orwell’s Newspeak, Jews are Nazis, Israel is  an apartheid state and a free Palestine will be “Judenrein” from the  Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Ideology has won. A cogent analysis of  historical reality is dead. We are all the losers, except for those who want to  wipe Jews and their state off the map.

<title>Israel’s Christian minority</title>
<date>6/4/2016</date>
<content>
Christians in Israel, as well as all other minorities, understand today that  serving in the Israeli military is essential. Many Christians and other  minorities in Israel share the same fears: they understand that in this region,  Israel is the only island of safety that allows them freedom and democratic  rights.Christians and other minorities in Israel prosper and grow, while  in other countries in the Middle East, as well as in the Palestinian Authority,  they suffer heavily from the Islamic movement and persecution – until forced to  disappear.




Contrary to propaganda, there is no “apartheid” of any kind in  Israel, and no roads on which only Jews may travel. Those roads are in Saudi  Arabia, which has real apartheid roads, since only Muslims may travel to  Mecca.In Israel, members of the Christian and Muslim minorities fill all  types of high positions. There is a Maronite Christian Supreme Court judge,  Salim Joubran.Widely discussed in the region is how the Europeans  secretly want Israel wiped out, too, and are hoping that their new laws,  combined with old Arab violence, will do the trick. That way, the Europeans can  pretend to themselves that they had nothing to do with it. These Europeans need  to know they are not fooling anyone.Last year, Israel recognized the  existence of a group of Christians – “Arameans” – within its borders; something  no Arab or Muslim nation in the Middle East has ever done or would ever do.  Israel recognized a distinct religious and ethnic group: the indigenous people  of the ancient Fertile Crescent. Their language, Aramaic, was the language  spoken by Jesus centuries before Islam came to the region.Israel not  only supports and gives Christians and other minorities – Druse, Muslims,  Baha’i, everyone – full civil rights, freedom and legal rights to exist  peacefully and practice their faith as they wish, but also to develop themselves  as a minority with all the implications of differences in culture. Arabs, for  instance, are welcomed into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but are not, as  opposed to Jews, required to serve. Prime minister David Ben-Gurion humanely did  not want Arabs to feel as if they were obliged fight their  “brothers.”Israel does all this, moreover, in a region where most of its  neighbors – often the most brutal enemies of humanity – wish Israel were wiped  out and often do their utmost to make this wish come true. Sadly, many Europeans  join in. Everyone has seen the recent vicious attempts by the European Union to  snuff out Israel economically by labeling goods made in disputed  territories.This requirement, made of no other country with a disputed  border, actually hinders any prospects for peace.These Europeans are not  fooling anyone. Their slyly sadistic, self-righteous “punishments” of Israel  will only throw thousands of Palestinians out of well-paying, badly-needed jobs;  these diktats also drive many newly-out-of-work Palestinians to the employment  bureau of last resort: Islamic extremism and terrorism.Ironically, these  Europeans, to satisfy their desire to hurt Jews by pretending to help  Palestinians, are actually seeding a new crop of terrorists who will later come  to Europe and show them what they think of such hypocrites.Israel,  meanwhile, despite having to deal with the European and American fronts as well  as often genocidal Muslim threats, continues actively to strengthen its minority  communities through a variety of state-sponsored programs. Among them is a  five-year plan to develop Israeli Arab and other minority communities adopted by  the government on December 30, 2015, at cost of NIS 15 billion (roughly  $4b.).Social Equality Minister Gila Gamliel, of the Likud Party, is in  charge of implementing the plan.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who  is unjustly demonized, has for the past several years operated the “Authority  for the Economic Development of the Arab, Druse and Circassian Sectors.” It is  headed by an Arab Muslim, Aiman Saif, who controls a sizable budget of NIS 7b.  (roughly $1.8b.), which has mostly gone to Arab cities and villages to develop  modern infrastructure, industrial zones, employment opportunities, education and  other elements.The rest was allocated to helping Christian villages in  the Galilee.Arabs have their own section in the Education Ministry,  headed by an Arab Muslim, Abdalla Khateeb, who is also in charge of a sizable  budget of NIS 900 million ($230 million).THE MUSLIM Arab community in  Israel, as well as the Christian and other Arabic-speaking communities, see the  tragic destiny of their brothers in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and other Arab  countries. Muslims killing Muslims; fanatical Muslim groups killing Christians,  uprooting them, slitting their throats, burning them alive, drowning them in  cages and of course crucifying them, even little children. Israel’s minorities  are very aware of this. They also cannot understand why no one is demonizing  these villains.They fear that this devastation will spread, first to the  holy land of Israel, and then to Europe.This fear is one of the reasons  there have been increasing numbers of Christians applying to serve in the IDF:  30 percent recruitment on a voluntary basis, while in general Jewish society the  number stands for 57% on an obligatory basis. Today there are more than 1,000  Muslim Arabs serving in the IDF.We all know the danger of these  fanatical Islamic jihadist groups such as Hamas, and feel ever more committed to  protect this lone pluralistic state.The community to which this author  belongs, Aramean Christians, is of Aramean-Phoenician ethnic roots and language,  and was originally based in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Over the 1,400 years  following the Islamic conquest, Aramean Christians were forced to switch to  speaking Arabic, and more recently to flee their homes in Syria and Iraq. They  have no status in Arab and Islamic states, most ruled according to Islamic  Sharia law. Aramean Christians also have no status in the Palestinian Authority,  which now rules Judea and Samaria.We are aware of some Christian groups,  such as Sabeel, Kairos Palestine and others under the thumb of the Palestinian  Authority who still feel the need to pay lip service to the Muslim Arab lords  who have conquered them.Jerusalem is open to everyone. But it has not  always been, especially under the jurisdiction of Jordan until 1967. Not only  were Jews not allowed in, but 38,000 Jewish gravestones were taken from the  Mount of Olives cemetery and used as building materials and flooring for  latrines.Muslim Arab members of Israel’s Knesset [parliament] reject the  right of Christians to preserve their unique heritage. On February 5, 2014,  Knesset member Haneen Zoabi of the Joint List party threatened the Israeli  Christian representatives who lobbied in the Knesset Employment Committee in  favor of a law that would add Christian representatives to a committee on  employment equality in the Economy and Trade Ministry.Zoabi rejected  their declaration that they were of a separate Aramean Christian ethnicity. She  insisted on forcing upon them an Arab and Palestinian identity.This  identification was of course as false as if we Christians had insisted that  Muslim Arabs call themselves Native Americans. The law passed despite the  efforts of Zoabi and her colleagues, due to a coalition of Knesset members –  with vast majority of Jewish MKs voting in favor of it.This incident  illustrates how some of Israel’s Muslim Arabs, while asking their Jewish  neighbors for help in preserving their own heritage, seek to deny other ethnic  minorities these same rights.Instead, they try to impose Arabization and  Palestinization by threats and by force. In September 2014, for instance, an  Aramean Christian woman, IDF Capt.Areen Sha’abi, was stalked by Arab  Muslim activists in Nazareth. She was threatened with shouts of “Allahu Akbar”  and at night her car tires were slashed.IDF Maj. Ehab Shlayan, an  Aramean Christian in Nazareth and the founder of the Christian Recruitment  Forum, awoke on the morning of August 2015 to find that a Palestinian flag had  been put in front of his door during the night. On Christmas Eve, December 24,  2014, 30 Muslims armed with stones and glass bottles attacked a Christian  soldier, 19-year-old Majd Rawashdi, and his home.All this is hypocrisy  of the highest order, mixed with racism.In an official Christmas  greeting to Israel’s Christians on December 24, 2012, Prime Minister Netanyahu  said: “Israel’s minorities, including over one million citizens who are Arabs,  always have full civil rights. Israel’s government will never tolerate  discrimination against women. Israel’s Christian population will always be free  to practice their faith. This is the only place in the Middle East where  Christians are fully free to practice their faith. They don’t have to fear; they  don’t have to flee. At a time when Christians are under siege in so many places,  in so many lands in the Middle East, I am proud that in Israel Christians are  free to practice their faith, and that there is a thriving Christian community  in Israel.”The author is founder of the Israeli Aramaic  Movement.Prior to graduating from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,  he served as a lieutenant in the IDF paratrooper division.He is also an  entrepreneur, a community leader and candidate for Israel’s Knesset.

<title>It’s not just Jerusalem Day</title>
<date>4/6/2016</date>
<content>
As a nation we’re embarrassed by the return to our land. We take great pride  every year on Independence Day, boasting of our 2,000-year wait and our success  in reestablishing sovereignty in our own land. Yet we hadn’t returned to all of  our land; the United Nations voted to only give us half. The Land of Israel that  was promised to us by God, that we prayed to return to, that we pined for  through Crusades, pogroms and in concentration camps is double the size of what  the UN gave us. The land stretches from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean  Sea and includes our capital city, Jerusalem. Even though it was half of what we  deserved, we gladly took the deal, for we weren’t willing to give up the  opportunity of a return to our land.I have to imagine that there were  mixed emotions in Jewish and Zionist communities when the UN’s partition plan  was announced. On the one hand, after 2,000 years we were going to return to our  land – yet we weren’t given what we deserved. These Jews were probably  apprehensive about defending half the land; Israel wasn’t designed to be so  thin. The borders must’ve seemed indefensible.




It wasn’t until 19 years  later that we finally returned to the full land. In June 1967, Israel won the  Six Day War and took over the western bank of the Jordan River.For  thousands of years this area was called Yehuda and Shomron (Judea and Samaria).  We were finally back in the greater Israel, the entire land that was ours.  Cities such as Nablus, Hebron and of course, Jerusalem’s Old City, were finally  in our control. For the first time in two millennia, Jews could travel to the  cities of our past, the cities which existed as prayers for the future, and call  them the cities of our present.Why don’t we celebrate our complete  return to all of Eretz Yisrael? On Jerusalem Day we skip half the  celebration.It’s almost as if so many great things happened in 1967 we  recognized that we can’t celebrate them all, so we picked the biggest event and  said we’ll just celebrate that. We decided to name the day after that event and  we have parades that celebrate it, and that’s enough. We celebrate the  reunification of Jerusalem, and call it Jerusalem Day. What about celebrating  the return to the complete Israel? The world vilifies Israel for controlling its  complete land. History is denied, our people’s dreams are delegitimized and we  are made to feel shamed in our own home. The world says our land is the  Palestinians’ land and our narrative is false. I don’t deny that Palestinians  have lived here for close to a thousand years, but that doesn’t negate that the  land is ours.Our response to the world’s denial of our history has been  nothing but pitiful. Even the strongest of pro-Israel organizations don’t face  the world’s challenge headon, preferring to focus on other important areas of  contention like delegitimizing the boycott movement and claiming Israel’s right  to self-defense, all the while quietly shying away from the charge of occupation  and apartheid. We need a different approach. We need to proudly declare that we  belong in Judea and Samaria.We need to face the charge of occupation  with the response that it’s our land. We need to educate and explain that just  because the UN didn’t give us all that was ours doesn’t mean we don’t deserve  our full land.We need the world to understand that there are two sides  to the story, and eventually be convinced that our side is the correct  one.There is theory that the eastern mountains in Judea and Samaria  naturally protect Israel’s western flank.Armies invade Israel from the  east and the mountains’ arduous ranges stave off attack. The same protection  Judea provides the rest of Israel in war, it provides in the world’s courts. If  we flattened the mountains we’d open ourselves to attack, and if we give in to  the world’s delegitimization of greater Israel, we’re opening ourselves to  charges of delegitimizing our claim to western Israel as well.Jerusalem  Day’s celebration should be extended past the reunification of Jerusalem to the  return to greater Israel. Those who advocate for Israel should begin including  Israel’s right to Judea and Samaria in their talking points, and groups should  make sure to include fun, historical and educational spots in Judea and Samaria  as part of their itineraries. It’s time we took pride in our land and let the  world know that we aren’t going to leave this land simply because they say we  should.

<title>It’s not the occupation, it’s their ideology</title>
<date>16/2/2016</date>
<content>
US Secretary of  State John Kerry is despondent about Israel’s future.Without an  immediate and comprehensive freeze on all Jewish settlement activity in the  occupied West Bank, Kerry argues, the occupation will never unwind.




And  according to Kerry, it is the occupation of the West Bank – Jews living in the  heartland of their biblical homeland – which imperils Israel’s identity as a  democratic Jewish state. Annex the territories and Israel loses its Jewish  identity; maintain the occupation and Israel soils its democracy.US  Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro shares John Kerry’s despair for Israel, but  with a sense of dire urgency. Shapiro insists that Kerry’s nightmare scenario is  already upon us. In the West Bank, says Shapiro, Israel operates an apartheid  regime – my words, not his – not just in fact but in law.As he recently  put it – his words, not mine – in the occupied territories Israel applies one  standard of legality to the Jewish settlers, and a second harsher and somewhat  arbitrary standard of legality to the indigenous Arab population. And Shapiro is  worried sick that current political conditions on the West Bank provide a very  disturbing peek into Israel’s agonizing future.Kerry and Shapiro are men  of enormous good will and their anxieties about Israel’s democratic and Jewish  future are heartfelt and genuine. But those anxieties are animated by a terrible  double standard. No, not the double standard of anti-Semitism (or self-hatred)  against which these men are thoroughly inoculated. Rather, Kerry and Shapiro are  captives of a uniquely American double standard. This double standard, what I  call the American ideology, originated in Calvinist individualism as a function  of the Protestant ethic serving essentially salvational purposes. But this  otherworldly function was soon subverted by its own latent economic consequences  and Calvinism’s radical individualism became the psychic core of American  capitalism, stimulating the emergence of the self-directed heroic American  market-man.Over time, the American market-man, the freely-covenanting  individual citizen of the United States of America, became the sole arbiter of  social reality and cultural legitimacy. Currently, this individualist mentality  defines all markers of group identification and affiliation – religion, race,  ethnicity, gender, sexual preference, class and even nationality – as mere  lifestyle choices, subject to change by nothing more than the whim and the will  of the individual.The American ideology is deeply suspicious of all  institutions that are not the product of the freely-covenanting individual,  except, of course, for its own political institutions. America’s political  institutions, which incarcerate the American market-man within their rules and  regulations, deforming or derailing the political preferences of the  freely-covenanting individual American citizen, also derive from the Protestant  ethic, albeit not from its radical individualism. Rather, they originate in  Calvinism’s austere monotheism which posits an unbridgeable gulf between Creator  and created. In order to maintain this unbridgeable gulf, the Calvinist ethic  compels its radical individuals to rationalize all other separations and  distinctions.This compulsion fuels an obsession with drawing exact and  articulate territorial boundary lines in order to demarcate one parcel of land  from another. In personal affairs, these lines of demarcation define the limits  of one’s private property. And in political affairs they express the outer reach  of the nation’s sovereignty.Herein lies the dirty secret of the American  ideology, the source of the double standard which distorts the judgment of good  and caring men like Kerry and Shapiro. In the United States of America,  nationhood is not produced by the freely- covenanting individual nor is it  subject to challenge based upon the changing personal or political preferences  of the heroic American market-man. Rather, in America, nationhood is completely  detached from the qualities and characteristics of the individual citizen, from  the color of his skin, or the cadence of his mother tongue, or the content of  his belief code. In America, nationhood is produced by the territorial boundary  lines which define and delimit the sovereign authority of the American state.  Those who live or were born inside of those territorial boundary lines are  members of the American nation whether they promote or belittle the American way  of life.And there is more. American democracy, the crowning glory of the  American way of life, the very standard by which the American nation identifies  itself, is also not defined by the individual citizens on the simple basis of  one man, one vote. Instead, America discharges its democratic commitments  according to the territorial boundary lines which separate the states of the  union from each other. Thus, the winner of every presidential election – the  democratically elected leader of the nation who is also the symbol of American  nationhood – is decided not by “we the people” but by the Electoral College, an  utterly impersonal political institution which derives its identity from  America’s internal boundary lines. As we learned to the surprise of many in  America’s millennium-year presidential election, this is the case even when a  clear majority of the American people cast their ballot for another  candidate.But according to Kerry and Shapiro, these features of the  American ideology are not applicable to Israel, despite the fact that the Jewish  tradition also originates in a doctrine of austere monotheism. Instead, these  men of enormous good will insist that Israel’s Jewish identity hinges on only  one matter: maintaining a strong majority of citizens who self-identify as Jews.  Israel will be courting a disaster, they warn, if it were to trifle with the  majoritarian principle that alone sustains its Jewish identity.Annexing  the West Bank – or implementing any other version of the one-state solution –  would force Israel to extend full citizenship to the Arab population enfolded  within its sovereignty, effectively sacrificing its affiliation with Judaism.  There simply are not enough Jews within the boundaries of Greater Israel for the  State of Israel to continue being the sovereign nation-state of the Jewish  people.Nothing could be further from the truth.If the State of  Israel were to extend its sovereignty up to its biblical boundary lines in  deference to Judaism’s doctrine of austere monotheism, those boundary lines  would themselves become the source of the state’s Jewish identity. At that  point, Israel could lift the occupation which does indeed soil its democracy,  without compromising its national identity. In fact, transferring the source of  the state’s national identity from the individual citizen to the impersonal  institution would be a boon, first and foremost, to Israel’s enlarged Arab  minority.Their identity as non-Jewish citizens of the Jewish state would  be drained of its political significance exactly the way America’s impersonal  political institutions drain the political significance of the skin color of its  non-white citizens. Such, of course, would not be the case if Israel would, in  deference to men like Kerry and Shapiro, withdraw from the West Bank and set its  territorial boundary lines in utter disregard of Judaism’s monotheist  heritage.
I suspect that Kerry and Shapiro are so over-committed to an  Israeli abandonment of the West Bank that they will not see their own national  tradition in the extension of Israeli sovereignty to the boundary lines of  biblical Israel. But Kerry and Shapiro are not the only Americans with enormous  good will toward our state and its Jewish identity. And those other friends of  ours, by the multiple millions, will surely applaud us for detaching our  national identity from the personal qualities and characteristics of our  citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, and embracing instead the American ideology.  If only our government would begin to move our state in this  direction.

LETTERS Rooting out the rot 




How shocking that our so-called education system is  trying to blinker our young people the same way the South African government did  during the apartheid years (“Education Ministry under fire for ousting novel  about ‘emotionally stormy’ Jewish-Arab love story,” January  1).Fortunately, the author, Dorit Rabinyan, has a sense of humor and  stated to other media outlets: “It seems like someone in the Education Ministry  still believes in the power of literature to generate change in the malleable  souls of youth, and for some reason, that sounds optimistic to me.”  Unfortunately, the ministry probably doesn’t understand this profound  statement.Rabinyan has reached the heart of what is rotten in Israeli  society. Hopefully, now that she is in the spotlight, she will be in a position  to lead in eradicating the rot.We are building walls and fences, and  succumbing to fear.We are losing our sense of proportion and our sense  of humor. We are losing our chutzpah and courage. We are becoming unrecognizable  as the proud nation we were. Our only hope is to allow people like Rabinyan to  enlighten us and breathe sense into our national discourse.SUSAN TUCKER  
Netanya Law is an ass With regard to “Olmert’s fate” (Editorial, December 31),  former prime minister Ehud Olmert’s reduced prison sentence for criminal conduct  in the prolonged Holyland conspiracy trial is disproportionate.He  inflicted incalculable damage in faith and confidence.His sheer  arrogance to elude remorse for his crooked, characterless and immoral actions is  beyond belief.For his contemptible behavior, there should be a penalty  that is at least similar to the conviction for rape of former president Moshe  Katsav. What is the difference between illegal financial gratification and  illegal sexual gratification through the use of power and influence? This smug  serial criminal has made our justice system a laughing stock. In my opinion, the  law is an ass.JACK DAVIS 
JerusalemMissing the train? Isi Leibler has  joined the government in the caboose (“Jewish terrorism must be cauterized like  a cancer,” Candidly Speaking, December 31). It is cause and effect – the  government should have been up front with the engineer, clearing the tracks of  Palestinian terrorism. If it had done so, Jewish terrorism would never have  climbed aboard.In light of what has now happened, the only pertinent  question is, have we missed the train? DANIEL ABELMAN 
Jerusalem No to temptation  The Post has reported on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to appoint  Arye Deri interior minister (“Netanyahu to promote Deri in cabinet reshuffle,”  December 30), the job he held when he committed the various felonies that led to  his conviction and prison sentence.Such action would cause the prime  minister to violate a biblical law against placing a stumbling block before the  blind, as per Leviticus 19:14. He will be returning Deri to the scene of the  crime.To paraphrase singer Taylor Swift, haters gotta hate, and stealers  gotta steal. Netanyahu should find a position for Deri that involves no monetary  dealings.DAVID GLEICHER 
Jerusalem Misses the mark Seth J. Frantzman’s  piece demeaning Israel’s cultural and educational achievements (“Beware Israeli  parochialism: From the first Knesset to today,” Terra Incognita, December 28)  misses the mark.Comparing Knesset members from our first years of  independence and those of today is like comparing chalk and cheese. It’s  actually quite remarkable how similar they are, not how different they might  be.Regarding our educational achievements, I recently had the pleasure  to hear professor of education Dan Gibton address the English Speaking Friends  of Tel Aviv University about how much better Israeli education is than most  Israelis think. Among other facts, Gibton pointed out that Israel has the  highest percentage of college graduates of any country; that it trails only the  United States for students having the chance to obtain a college degree; and  that its universities are the highest ranking per capita in the  world.Compared to the US and most other nations, parochial we’re not.  I’d call Israel cosmopolitan, a salute to our incredible  nation-building.STEVE KRAMER 
Alfei Menashe 
The writer is chairman of  English Speaking Friends of Tel Aviv University.We come first Your  December 27 editorial “No kindness” disturbed me greatly, and I took  umbrage.According to Rabbi Akiva, your own life comes first, even if the  other person will die. This opinion is the halachic consensus.Saving the  terrorist, the one who strove to take a life, therefore is against  Halacha.Our lives come first.I admire and thank ZAKA for  refusing to abide by the Israel Medical Association’s utterly unconscionable,  politically correct senselessness. No comparisons intended here, but to make a  strong point, would the IMA have a Nazi saved before a Jew because his injuries  were more severe? SUSAN SHAIN 
Jerusalem Birds of a feather Regarding Martin  Sherman’s “Entente with Turkey – like lipstick on a pig?” (Into the Fray,  December 25), I love Sherman’s writing and agree with all of his very accurate  and convincing arguments. I just feel that for this topic, instead of  summarizing with “...little more than putting lipstick on the proverbial pig,”  it would have been more accurate to state that when dealing with Turkey, you  must expect fowl play!

Karnei Shomron Dental health in kids  Regarding “Cabinet expands free basic dental care to children aged 13 and 14”  (December 21), as a pediatric dentist – officially unrecognized as such in  Israel – with over 30 years of experience and currently practicing in the  private sector and with one of the health funds, there are several points of  importance regarding the “free” basic dental care.Reporter Judy Siegel  states that Dr. Shlomo Zusman, head of the dental health department of the  Health Ministry, could not explain why parents were not taking advantage of this  service. The obvious answer is lack of education among parents as to the  importance of good oral health.The government should be emphasizing this  for new parents, starting in Tipat Halav well-baby clinics and continuing in  preschools.This also explains Siegel’s point that the condition of  children’s teeth in Israel has not improved since the launching of the program  in 2010. Most parents are not bringing their children for regular check-ups and  often bring them only when the children are in pain. This type of care is not  conducive to dental health.As for the dentist’s role, in my own  experience, health funds do not make reimbursements for preventive dental exams.  Therefore, there is no incentive for regular check-ups. If I want to be  reasonably reimbursed for my time, it needs to be spent doing fillings,  extractions, etc.Early interventive dental education would have a  snowball effect that ultimately leads to improved dental health and thus  decreases dental expenses for all ages – a more economically sound situation for  the population, as well as for the government.

<title>JPost Editorial: Speaking for history</title>
<date>10/8/2016</date>
<content>
Is there a difference between an historian and a Jewish historian? The storm of  criticism unleashed last week by the confessions of two academics who virtually  renounced their previous identification with Israel suggests that the operative  distinction has more to do with an irrational self-loathing than with  scholarship.Professors Hasia Diner and Marjorie Feld published an  anti-Zionist screed in Haaretz dissociating themselves from a previous  identification with Zionism, which has become associated in their understanding  with racism, genocide and apartheid, just to cite a few of Israel’s alleged  crimes.




Diner begins her anti-Zionist rant with a simple confession: “The  Israel I once loved was a naïve delusion.” What a distance she has traveled from  the Habonim Zionist movement of her youth to today, as she writes, “I feel a  sense of repulsion when I enter a synagogue in front of which the congregation  has planted a sign reading, ‘We Stand With Israel.’” Diner writes that she could  not endorse the Jerusalem Program, because it affirms belief in “the centrality  of the State of Israel and Jerusalem as its capital” for the Jewish people.  This, she writes, is because it encourages aliya and “the classic negation of  the Diaspora and as such the ending of Jewish life outside a homeland in  Israel.”Straying further into the realm of the absurd and nonfactual,  she declares, “The death of vast numbers of Jewish communities as a result of  Zionist activity has impoverished the Jewish people.” What deaths of which  Jewish communities? Israel, she concludes, is “a place that I abhor visiting,  and to which I will contribute no money, whose products I will not buy, nor will  I expend my limited but still to me, meaningful, political clout to support  it.”Sovereign Israel cannot choose to absorb Jewish refugees and grant  them citizenship, Diner states, because “The Law of Return can no longer look to  me as anything other than racism.”Feld is no better, writing how she  learned from non-Jews in “liberal and left organizations in college” who opened  her eyes. “I saw that Israel fit neatly into my broader understanding of Western  colonialism.... The founding of Israel was the Nakba, the great catastrophe, for  Palestinians, with ethnic cleansing, destruction, and no right of return.” She  apparently sees no contradiction in the UN Partition Resolution of 1947 creating  an Arab and Jewish state which was accepted by the Jewish community and  violently rejected by the armies of half a dozen Arab countries.Diner is  a professor of American Jewish history at New York University and won an award  for her book We Remember with Reverence and Love: American Jews and the Myth of  Silence after the Holocaust, which dealt with the subject until 1962; Feld is  professor of history at Babson College and the author of Nations Divided:  American Jews and the Struggle over Apartheid, which dealt with the response of  US Jewry to the 1990 visit by Nelson Mandela.There has been a deluge of  outraged responses to Diner and Feld’s op-ed, but probably the most  authoritative were given by two fellow historians, one American and one Israeli  and both of them Jews. Preeminent Brandeis historian Jonathan Sarna accused  Diner and Feld of falling into a belief in “demonic” myths about Israel and said  they “sacrifice truth to advance their newfound ideology.”“Diner and  Feld’s current view is at least as much a ‘naïve delusion’ as the earlier one  that they rejected,” he wrote. “Sadly, instead of drawing serious, nuanced,  scholarly lessons from history, they have provided us with just what they claim  Israel’s supporters once gave them: propaganda.”Gur Alroey, a professor  and director of the Ruderman Program for American Jewish Studies at the  University of Haifa, wrote, “Prof. Diner’s historical arguments are incorrect  and unfortunately also unfounded. I fear her political agenda led to a  distortion in understanding Zionist and Israeli society’s history, going so far  as a complete denial of Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic  state. Her ideological observations on the story of the establishment of Israel  brought her to erroneous conclusions and to distort modern Jewish  history.”
Historians, Jewish or otherwise, should be able to understand  Zionism as the national liberation movement of the Jewish people and stop  denying Israel’s right to exist.

<title>JPost Letters to the Editor: Better bike is due</title>
<date>17/8/2016</date>
<content>
Better bike is dueWith regard to “Policemen who took Palestinian child’s bike  to be disciplined” (August 16), they should be made to buy her a new – and  better – bicycle, and deliver it to her personally, with an  apology.




Instilling fear in children is something bullies  do.ELAINE GOLDSTEIN Tzipori Ghattas in MontrealShame on The Jerusalem  Post for publishing “MK Ghattas calls to boycott Israel at anti-Semitic parley”  (August 15) as its lead story for the day.It is bad enough that Basel  Ghattas is a member of Knesset.We already have so many enemies in the  world today who try to boycott Israel – all your article does is give publicity  to Ghattas and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)  movement.JENNY SHAY JerusalemMK Basel Ghattas calls to boycott Israeli  goods, but he should remember that he, too, is “Israeli goods.” Has he forgotten  that he is an Arab MK and has more rights than the people in any Arab country,  never mind more rights than the blacks in South Africa had under apartheid?  Ghattas never mentions the treatment of Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon for  fear of his life.ISSY HASS Ra’ananaJoint List lawmaker Basel Ghattas  made his remarks in Montreal at the World Social Forum, which your article  describes as “meant to be a far-left alternative to the annual World Economic  Forum in Davos.”First, as a Canadian who made aliya more than 40 years  ago, I am truly ashamed that the city, provincial and federal governments there  could not cancel a conference dealing with BDS and anti-Semitic, anti-Israel  propaganda.Second, Ghattas is completely wrong to call Israel an  apartheid country. Israeli Arabs have all the rights of Israeli Jews. He, an  Arab, is an MK. Also, I just finished cancer treatment at Rambam Medical Center  in Haifa and was treated by Arab doctors.I saw Arabs doing all kinds of  jobs there, and spoke with many Arab patients. So apartheid does not exist in  Israel.Third, our government needs to have backbone and make the same  law that exists in Canada’s House of Commons so that Ghattas and the other two  Joint List MKs from Balad can be ejected, without receiving any government  pension or any other perks that a Knesset member receives when he or she  leaves.MURRAY JOSEPH Kiryat MotzkinRIP, Kenny With regard to “Kenny  Baker, ‘Star Wars’ actor behind R2-D2, dies at 81” (Arts & Entertainment,  August 15), I followed Baker’s rise to stardom for many years with great  pleasure, and was saddened to hear of his death. I knew this charming man many  years ago when I was running the office of the then-famous Ritz Ballroom in  Manchester, England, during the middle and late 1950s.Upon arriving for  work, everyone had to sign a book that was on a counter in my office. When the  door opened and no one was there, I got used to the fact that it was Kenny  signing in. He was so small that, beyond the counter, he was  invisible.He worked in the circus and in the pantomimes as the cat in  Puss in Boots. To help out his finances, he worked before and after the  pantomime season in the foyer of the Ritz with the doormen. They wore evening  dress, and he wore a perfectly fitted tuxedo and bow tie.We enjoyed our  office chats, and this culminated in an invitation from him to go out for lunch  – a shock to me, to say the least. But out to lunch we walked, out of the Ritz  doors onto New Oxford Street, with every head turning to gape. He was used to  this, but my heart was pounding.Suffice it to say, he had booked a table  in a very nice restaurant – I had told him to ask for vegetarian for me – where  he obviously was known, and we sat for two hours just talking. (I asked him  nothing about his childhood, of course.) He made an interesting remark I have  never forgotten – the more successful and more attractive the men and women he  knew, the nicer they were to him. They almost made him forget he was a  dwarf.I was thrilled to read of his success in Star Wars and thought of  writing him a letter, but could not really see the point. I just had a nice  feeling that after all his efforts and trials, he had made it – this tiniest of  men, with such a sweet face and a heart of gold.Rest in peace,  Kenny.LINDA HIRSCH NetanyaUltimate dispute Your August 12 editorial  “Observing Tisha Be’av” predictably drew criticism from several religiously  observant readers (“Tisha Be-av editorial,” Letters August 15).All could  agree that the vibrant population and religious life in Jerusalem today in no  way resemble the pictures of the abandoned, disgraced Jerusalem depicted in  Lamentations.Their points of contention lie in each one’s vision for the  ultimate Jerusalem.The religious Jew dreams of a day when God’s presence  is felt, not only through miraculous military victories, which have already been  achieved, but through a palpable and undeniable presence that finally brings our  enemies to stop their denial of our rights and their lethal aggression, and  inspires a global, God-centered devotion by Jews and non-Jews alike.The  ultimate dispute between the secular and religious perspectives is in the desire  for a Third Temple. The secular Jew views the very concept of a temple as a  medieval throwback, an embarrassment, completely unwelcome in the modern era.  I’d wager to guess that this thinking is the reason that our government allows  Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount to be treated abhorrently while Muslim  worshipers practice their faith unimpeded.Each day that the Third Temple  remains unbuilt, our sins of baseless hatred for fellow Jews render us guilty of  its previous destruction, so our yearning for its reconstruction is a form of  penance and contrition that cannot be eliminated.In Jewish thought,  there are opinions (notably those of the Rambam) that animal sacrifice was  necessary once, but due to the moral development of mankind, is no longer  appropriate and shall not be returned, being replaced by prayer. Whether or not  the practices of the Temple are modernized, the concept of a temple – which is  accompanied by the unity of the Jewish people as well as the intimate  relationship between God and the Jewish people – is essential to Jewish thought.  Thus, until it is rebuilt, fasting on Tisha Be’av is both appropriate and  necessary.SHARON LINDENBAUM RehovotDevilish style“With regard to “Few  show up for Israeli launch of Trump campaign” (August 16), if anyone believes  this presidential condidate, then you deserve what you get.I’m not too  keen on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but she far and away makes more  sense than Republican candidate Donald Trump, the man without a plan (other than  the wall, which, I predict, will never be built).We need a president who  will talk straight to voters and unite us, not a loudmouth, braggadocious,  divisive, trigger-happy TV celebrity who, I fear, will run this great nation  into the ground should he win.Hillary’s no angel, but Donald Trump’s  campaign style is nothing short of devilish.

<title>Keep BDS and bigotry away from Capitol Hill</title>
<date>17/10/2016</date>
<content>
The “US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation,” a national coalition of some  400 anti-Israel organizations in nearly all 50 states, held its annual  conference this past week in Arlington, Virginia.The final day of the  conference was designated as a congressional lobbying day on Capitol  Hill.




US Campaign members were scheduled to attempt to meet with their  elected representatives to further the organization’s agenda. The US Campaign is  a pro-Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions organization that denies the legitimacy  of Israel’s existence, demonizes the Jewish state, and calls for cutting all  ties between the United States and Israel. Its leadership and members are  supporters of terrorist groups and have a record of violence.The US  Campaign aggressively supports the BDS assault which calls for the boycott of  Israeli academics, cultural figures and businesses based solely on their Israeli  nationality. Therefore, institutions and groups that facilitate the US  Campaign’s BDS crusade may be violating US anti-discrimination and anti-BDS  legislation. Members of Congress must be advised of the ill-intentions of these  representatives of this discriminatory, bigoted and terrorism-supporting  organization who are seeking meetings with members of the House of  Representatives to legitimize their multi-front assault against the people and  State of Israel.Opposition to Israel’s existence The US Campaign was set  up in the spring and summer of 2001 by activists looking to end US support for  Israel. They launched their battle against the US-Israel relationship during the  tidal wave of Palestinian suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians  known as the second intifada. This BDS coalition now consists of some 400  anti-Israel, pro-BDS organizations from coast to coast.The BDS campaign  which the US Campaign endorses and promotes aims for the destruction of Israel  as a Jewish state. In the words of the founder and most prominent leader of the  BDS campaign, Palestinian engineer turned activist Omar Barghouti, “Definitely,  most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine.”The  BDS campaign also makes clear its opposition to the US policy of support for a  two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Barghouti  declaring, “Going back to the two-state solution, besides having passed its  expiry date, it was never a moral solution to start with.Anna Baltzer,  the US Campaign’s co-founder and director of organizing and advocacy, has  likewise declared that she opposes the existence of Israel, explaining, “I  recognized that the problem was not simply occupation, but rather the creation  and maintenance of an ethno-nationalist Jewish entity.... I realized occupation  was just one step in a much longer process, and I couldn’t simply oppose one and  not the other.”Ties to banned terrorist groups The leaders and members  of the US Campaign to “end the Israeli occupation” have supported and maintain  ties to terrorist groups. They also have a track record of violence and  incitement to destroy Israel.Baltzer has whitewashed the terrorist  activities of Fatah’s Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which has enjoyed the financial  backing of the Iranian regime and has sought additional assistance to enable  Gaza terrorist tunnel assaults to kill and kidnap Israeli civilians.The  Aksa Martyrs Brigades is one of the most violent Palestinian armed groups, and  has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, EU and  Canada.In a March 2007 article written from Nablus meant to convey the  “truth” about events in Palestine to American readers, Baltzer claimed, “It’s  worth noting that [Israeli] soldiers are the very targets of the wanted men, not  Israeli civilians. Al-Aksa Martyrs Brigade plans attacks against armed  fighters.”This is a violent distortion of reality. In truth, the Aksa  Martyrs Brigades has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks targeting Israeli  civilians in Israeli cities within the pre-1967 lines, in which hundreds of  civilians have been murdered or injured. For example, on January 5, 2003, two  Aksa Martyrs Brigades suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Tel Aviv  Central Bus Station, murdering 23 Israeli civilians and injuring over 100. In  fact, fewer than 90 days before Baltzer published her article, a Martyrs  Brigades terrorist walked into a bakery in Eilat and blew himself up, murdering  three Israeli civilians.Baltzer is hardly alone in her support for  terrorism and violence among the US Campaign leadership and membership. US  Campaign Steering Committee member Bekah Wolf is married to convicted Islamic  Jihad terrorist Mousa Abu Maria. US Campaign Steering Committee member Abe  Greenhouse was charged in 2007 with criminal mischief and unlawful possession of  a weapon. Greenhouse first gained notoriety when he threw a pie in the face of  former Soviet refusenik and Israeli cabinet minister Natan Sharansky while  Sharansky was delivering a lecture at Rutgers University in 2003.US  Campaign’s Hamas-supporting partner One of the US Campaign’s “member groups in  good standing for 2016” is the terrorism-supporting organization American  Muslims for Palestine.In April 2016, former US Treasury terrorism  finance analyst Jonathan Schanzer testified before Congress regarding the  numerous connections between AMP and three organizations that were shut down or  held civilly liable by the US government for providing financial support to the  Hamas terrorist group.For example, the Holy Land Foundation was  designated by the US Treasury as a terrorist-supporting entity in 2001 for  having channeled approximately $12.4 million to Hamas. One of the foundation’s  officers was identified by Hamas’s top official as “the Hamas leader for the  US.” While a number of foundation officials fled the United States or were  convicted, at least three have transferred to central positions in American  Muslims for Palestine, which has become one of the most significant funders of  the violent campus BDS group Students for Justice in Palestine, providing money,  speakers, training and even “apartheid walls” to SJP activists on  campus.BDS discrimination and antisemitism The BDS campaign calls for  the boycott of Israeli academics, cultural figures and businesses, based solely  on the criterion that they are Israeli. Furthermore, as BDS singles out and  demonizes the world’s only Jewish state, and in practice often targets Jewish  supporters of Israel, it has frequently been described as antisemitic. For that  reason, 13 US states, as well as Congress, have passed legislation aimed at  combating BDS.The blatant discrimination inherent in the US Campaign is  prohibited by the Washington, DC, Human Rights Act which states, “It is the  intent of the Council of the District of Columbia... to secure an end in the  District of Columbia to discrimination for any reason other than that of  individual merit, including, but not limited to, discrimination by reason of  race, color, religion, national origin.”
The US Campaign to End the  Israeli Occupation is now attempting to deceive Congress in order to gain  legitimacy and support. It must not be allowed to lobby America’s elected  representatives. Instead, this violence-supporting BDS coalition must be  unmasked, isolated and boycotted. Members of Congress, regardless of their  stance regarding Israel’s presence in the post-1967 disputed territories, must  reject requests to be approached by representatives of an organization that  calls for the destruction of a US ally, supports terrorism and violence, and  promotes discriminatory and antisemitic policies.

<title>Know Comment: Navigating the tumultuous Middle East</title>
<date>4/2/2016</date>
<content>
With much of the Middle East state structure crumbling, Israel needs innovative  strategic thinking about its diplomatic and defense policies.How should  Israel maneuver between America and Russia, or position itself among the  competing Arab blocs? How does Israel maintain freedom of action, build  alliances, and improve its qualitative edge? A great deal of deliberation on  these matters is conducted behind closed doors in the national security  establishment, to which the public is rarely exposed. It is only when key  figures leave government service and begin to give fuller articulation of their  views that a clearer picture emerges.




The recent retirement from decades  of government service by Col. (res.) Dr.Eran Lerman is just such an  opportunity.One of the most respected intellectuals to emerge from IDF  Military Intelligence’s research directorate, Lerman served for the past six  years as deputy for foreign policy and international affairs at the National  Security Council in the Prime Minister’s Office.In this post, he was a  key point person for diplomats, intelligence officials, academics and Jewish  community leaders from around the world seeking elucidation of Israeli strategy  and policy.Since emerging from the shadows, Lerman has begun teaching at  Shalem College and joined the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies as a  senior research associate. There he has penned a series of far-reaching analyses  from which a comprehensive perspective on Israel’s regional positioning and  priorities becomes clear.In Lerman’s thinking, Israel is blessed with  exciting new alliance possibilities in both the eastern Mediterranean and the  Arab world; is on the cusp of expanding its strategic ties to Continental, Asian  and Gulf powers, including Russia; and must have the wherewithal to withstand a  long struggle with rejectionist and reactionary Palestinian leaders, since peace  is a distant reality.Lerman believes that the flourishing new  relationship between Israel and her two Hellenic neighbors in the eastern  Mediterranean – Greece and Cyprus – is important on its own merits.But  equally important, he says, is that the Israel-Greece-Cyprus alliance seeks to  block Turkey’s ambitions of regional hegemony; while holding open a key place  for Ankara in the new Mediterranean political order, if and when Turkey’s AKP  leaders come to their senses.To this end, Lerman initiated the convening  of a major international conference on strategic challenges in the Eastern  Mediterranean at the BESA Center (February 17-18). Participants will take a  critical look at regional threats and opportunities for regional cooperation,  among key eastern Mediterranean countries and actors, including Cyprus, Egypt,  Greece, Israel, Italy, and Turkey, as well as the EU, NATO and the  US.“The eastern Mediterranean is the border between civilizations,”  Lerman says. “It is a zone where many critical problems are coming to the fore,  including the advance of radical Islam, refugee issues, energy politics,  superpower competition, and Iranian expansionism. Israel can be the linchpin of  a new coalition of countries that promote stability.”Lerman also has  exposed a bit of Israel’s maneuvering in the tumultuous Arab Middle East. In an  essay last month entitled “New Permutations in the Mideast Game of Camps,” he  describes the region as divided into four rival blocs: Iran with her proxies and  allies; the Salafi jihadists (such as ISIS); the Muslim Brotherhood movement in  its various manifestations, including Hamas, supported by Qatar and Turkey; and  the “forces of stability” – meaning all those who fear and resist the rise of  the first three camps, with Israel an active and important player in this latter  camp.“It is premature, and at this stage unwise, to speak of the  emergence of a coherent and strong camp of stability, acting in close  cooperation,” Lerman says. “The Saudis seriously differ with Egypt over Syria;  Turkey’s shift has yet to mature; and the Palestinians have latched on to a wave  of terrorism as a political tool. But the grand strategic interests among these  parties increasingly cohere, and Israel has what to offer.”Confirmation  of Lerman’s perspective can be found in the surprisingly frank remarks made this  week by Maj.-Gen. Nitzan Alon, chief of the IDF Operations Branch. The IDF is  sharing intelligence with allies battling the Islamic State group, he admitted,  which “makes Israel effectively part of the coalition against ISIS,” even though  Israel remains on the sidelines of the fighting in Syria and Iraq.Lerman  also sees Israeli opportunities in the effective partition of  Syria.“There is a contradiction between the ultimate purposes of Russia  and Iran in their intervention in Syria. Iran wants the Syrian Golan as a base  of operations against Israel; but there is no reason for Russia to support  that.“Putin’s concern for Assad’s survival could give Israel some policy  leverage, if Israel astutely navigates its way through the situation. This means  that Israel should not be tempted to support Saudi- led efforts to unseat Assad  or otherwise bring about a decisive outcome in Syria’s civil  war.”Together with his BESA Center colleague Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaakov  Amidror, Lerman also has written about Israel’s strategic interest in Jordanian  security and prosperity, revealing a broad-ranging series of Israel-Jordanian  cooperative ventures in security, diplomacy, economy and energy.Most of  all, Lerman has shined critical light on Palestinian rejectionism and extremism.  In several recent articles, he demonstrates that Palestinian wallowing in  self-pity and rituals of bashing Israel, along with blatant lie-telling, make  peace a distant reality.“My purpose is not to demonize the Palestinians,  but to treat them, for a change, as adults capable of coping with a culture of  responsibility,” Lerman says.Lerman deconstructed the speech delivered  by Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas at the UN General Assembly in  October, and a “media guidance” document issued by top PLO negotiator Saeb  Erekat in November.Both documents purvey a false Palestinian narrative  of victimhood, contain utter lies about Israel, and reject any compromise on key  matters in dispute.In the Abbas and Erekat telling of history,  Palestinians deserve to be backed by coercive global intervention to impose on  Israel “solutions that will implement Palestinian rights.” There is no room in  these narratives for the long litany of Palestinian past mistakes, misjudgments,  and missed opportunities, nor for negotiation with Israel.What needs to  be done, says Lerman, particularly in disputation or in dialogue with those who  are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, is to make the point that endorsement  of the false Palestinian narrative harms the Palestinians’ own  future.“By tagging the Zionist project as ‘colonialist’ in nature (i.e.,  transient and perishable), those who do so help consign the Palestinian people,  whom they purport to help, to an ideological, political and diplomatic  cul-de-sac.”Erekat’s “Key Points to Remember when Reporting on Occupied  Palestine” (a document distributed in November to foreign media based in Israel)  is filled with bravado, distortion and mendacities, Lerman says. The document  rants about “Israel’s occupation, colonization, apartheid and culture of  impunity,” while making wholly untrue statements about history, about  international law, and about Jerusalem and the Temple Mount.“Saeb  Erekat’s record of lies and dissimulations is legion, and he seems to be getting  worse as he ages,” adds Lerman.“He has been a central factor in the  Palestinian Authority’s abandonment of peace talks with Israel and its move to  confrontation with Israel in international forums. His propaganda warps the  truth and undermines peace efforts. History will yet record his abysmal  diplomatic role in the many mistakes of the Palestinian national  movement.”

<title>LETTERS: Ketuba as proof</title>
<date>30/11/2016</date>
<content>
Ketuba as proof According to Zichron Ya’acov Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abramovski, if your ketuba has been destroyed, it’s as if your marriage does not exist (“If your ketuba was destroyed by fire – can you still cohabitate?” November 29).




Apparently, this would be an easy way to get a get (Jewish ritual divorce). So why shouldn’t people seeking such a divorce just destroy their ketuba? M. SCHAEFFER Jerusalem Crowing over Trump Many of our right-wing ministers and MKs could not conceal their unbridled joy at the results of the US presidential election.These politicians released arrogant and oh-so-premature statements about a Trump presidency ushering in a new era for US-Israel relations in terms of an end to the two-state solution and a total free pass to build wherever and whenever we want in Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even had to order them to turn down the rhetoric, but of course, our illustrious leaders found various ways to circumvent even that directive.I only hope that these same individuals read “Jewish Democrats cry hypocrisy over US general’s Israel remarks” (November 29), about the likely appointment of Marine Gen. James Mattis as President-elect Donald Trump’s defense secretary. Mattis’s statements about the “settlements” possibly leading to “apartheid,” and the Israeli-Palestinian status- quo being “unsustainable,” should certainly throw cold water on their assumptions about the Trump victory ushering in a virtual messianic era for construction in all the disputed territories.Notwithstanding the very reasonable expectation that Trump will be much more friendly to Israel than his predecessor, none of us really has a clue how things will develop until he actually takes office, and no doubt there will be many surprises, good and bad.The gushing praise for Trump and his various potential appointments is not only embarrassing and counterproductive, it gives the impression that American policy and politics are more important than our own sovereignty and independence in deciding our destiny and future.GERSHON HARRIS Hatzor Haglilit Undeserving piece With regard to “When Obama became Peres” (Comment & Features, November 29), who does Ilan Manor know that his graduate school meanderings regularly get a prominent placement in the opinion pages of The Jerusalem Post? Why should I care what a graduate student thinks? Manor’s latest epiphany, about Shimon Peres – a man I hardly admired for his second-act conversion to unrepentant peacenik – is totally without foundation.Peres traded philosophic purity for public affection? Where is the evidence? This is just another example of interpretive, speculative journalism that has brought the profession to unprecedented low esteem, and yet another poor example of judicious editing.This piece did not deserve the light of day.YISRAEL GUTTMAN Jerusalem Only in IsraelReader Sandrine Newman’s letter about people who look like tourists falling prey to unscrupulous Israelis (“Targets for cheats,” November 29) reminded me of the opposite – of a recent taxi journey from Ben-Gurion Airport to my home.Before we started, I was asked if I wanted a fixed price of NIS 150, or to be “on the meter.” I chose the meter. The driver then asked if he could use Waze, as there was heavy traffic.I agreed.There was indeed heavy traffic, and Waze took us on a long and circuitous route. When the meter showed NIS 150 and we were still some way from Rehovot, the driver turner the meter off, saying “You will have to pay too much.”I told him to turn the meter back on, as I had agreed to both the meter and Waze. We then had a loud argument: I wanted to pay more, he wanted to charge less.Only in Israel!ROGER KAYE Rehovot Preventing firesI fear that reader Daniel Farb (“Raging fires,” Letters, November 28) is making a fundamental mistake when he claims: “The real problem behind the fires plaguing Israel is negligent forestry management.” This might have been correct regarding the 2010 Carmel forest fires, but it seems that many of those in recent days were the result of arson.His suggested remedies, including “the separation of areas by blank land to contain fires; watchtowers; and, above all, the clearing of brush,” might have lessened the effect. Unfortunately, though, they were more likely to have prompted the determined arsonists to counter them by starting more, albeit smaller, fires so that the total devastation would not have been greatly reduced.Only when the Palestinians decide that the destruction of Israel is less important than building up their own society will such nihilistic behavior stop.But that will probably happen only with the coming of Messiah.MARTIN D. STERN Salford, UK Unconditional love Kudos to Lior Yisraelov’s parents for accepting him as he is (“Israel’s favorite drag queen is this former yeshiva boy,” Comment & Features, November 27).As difficult as it must have been for them as an Orthodox family, the Yisraelovs eventually had to realize that Lior was their child, no matter what he was going through. Such unconditional love is what keeps families together and allows children, teens and even adults in crisis to get through their toughest times.CHAYA HEUMAN Ginot Shomron Since Judaism purportedly advocates tolerance, compassion, mercy and humanity, it is monstrously cruel and unjust to urge the murder of homosexuals. This passage should be expurgated from the Torah, which was written and edited by fallible human beings rather than by God.Members of the gay community should be viewed as victims of an incurable illness rather than as sinners. Unlike their persecutors, they pose no threat to society or to Jewish values. Because Judaism is family-based and family- centered, our bigoted religious establishment regards them as a threat to its vested interests.Inciting people to murder gays is reminiscent of the Nazis’ wholesale murder of homosexuals along with the disabled, a policy that has been thoroughly condemned by all civilized societies.We must strive our utmost to make Judaism more humane, to the point of accepting gays as merely different rather than damnable.ROY RUNDS Tel Aviv Incident on a bus On a recent morning, I was on a bus to central Jerusalem and got to talking with the lady sitting opposite, who was from Abu Ghosh.The ticket inspector came. She looked everywhere and couldn’t find hers, so he took her details and said she would be fined NIS 100. I offered to buy her a ticket, but she insisted that she would pay.Then another woman from Abu Ghosh couldn’t find her ticket. She refused to pay the fine and broke down. The inspector told me to not interfere. The woman tearfully appealed to the driver to confirm that she had indeed paid, but he refused to say anything.At this stage, the inspector told the driver to stop and called the police. I had to leave, but in any case had been told by the stonefaced inspector to stay out of it. I don’t know how the story ended, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth.There must be better ways of dealing with such cases. I urge Egged to learn a lesson from this in order not to rend still further the already fragile fabric of Jewish- Arab coexistence.

<content>
Yemenite children In my work on genetic genealogy, I see American colleagues  reporting each week on a handful of successes in matching adopted and abandoned  children with their birth families, as well as with unknown birth fathers. There  is no reason that this technique cannot be applied here for missing Yemenite and  other children from the early days of the state (“Yemenite children,” Editorial,  June 24).Every parent or sibling with a story about a missing child  should take an autosomal DNA test; a parent or sibling of the same gender as the  missing child should take an additional test, too. These tests will probably not  produce much in the way of immediate results, but descendants of the missing  children might eventually want to know where they come from, and having the  results on file under the supervision of a genealogist will make this very  doable, even if the parents and siblings are no longer alive.




This seems  so obvious to me that the fact that it is not being done makes me wonder who  doesn’t want it to happen.ISRAEL PICKHOLTZ Jerusalem 
The writer is a  veteran genealogist who explores the intersection of documentary genealogy and  the latest developments in autosomal DNA. His book on Jewish DNA, ENDOGAMY: One  Family, One People, was published by Colonial Roots.At a time when we  are being slandered by the whole world, the evil ones among us bring up once  again the painful matter of missing babies. It is meant to set Jew against Jew  and add to the effort to destroy the Jewish state.I don’t believe that  any Jew would purposely kidnap a baby.The period when this is supposed  to have happened was absolutely chaotic, with our pathetic refugees pouring in  from all sides. There were hardly enough medical people to save lives, let alone  do the necessary but endless paper work.(Remember, the paper work was  done by hand; there were no computers.) So there were mix-ups! But there was no  kidnapping of precious little ones.I imagine that sealing the records is  a political gesture to save face. But see how it is being interpreted? Guilty!  The hateful Jew is guilty again!IDA PLAUT Netanya It’s the apartheid bitWhile  I am in full agreement with the basic message of your June 23 editorial “Coping  with BDS,” it nevertheless illustrates how profoundly both commentators and  people in government are missing what is probably the most important single  aspect of the BDS movement. Our fixation on anti-Semitism is producing a skewed  vision of, and a skewed emphasis on, what is driving BDS worldwide and how to  fight it.You fail to mention the fact that BDS techniques have worked in  the past, in the instance of South Africa. That is one of the main reasons why  BDS movements hold “anti-apartheid” commemorations.It’s the one thing  that tells them over and over that they are on a winning streak.Telling  us, as your editorial does, that Israel is a strong economy that has the full  backing of multiple Jewish organizations in the US means nothing. In the 1970s  and 1980s, South Africa’s economy was booming. Its relationships with major  world governments (primarily with US president Ronald Reagan and British prime  minister Margaret Thatcher) were solid, and anti-apartheid actions were nothing  more than a nuisance manifesting themselves on performance stages and sport  fields.A decade later, though, white South Africa was gone. It was not  because the South Africans had lost a physical war; it was because they had lost  the self-respect and moral assurance needed to go on fighting. The rest of the  world detested them.BDS against Israel will go on working while we  ignore this historical achievement. The way to fight it most effectively is by  disassociating ourselves from the apartheid of South Africa, on the one hand by  showing how profoundly we differ, and on the other by telling the world what  apartheid really was.In the 20th century, there were many manifestations  of evil regimes, of which white South Africa was just one. Many were far worse.  For a range of reasons, including the sense of guilt of a West that both bred  white supremacism and profited from it, the world has now fixated on that one  aspect above all the others, and we are allowing it to flay us so it can appease  its conscience.HENRY KAYE Ashkelon Just an adjective Let us not blur the  distinction between ultra-Orthodox and modern Orthodox Jews (“Time to trash  ‘ultra’? A response,” Comment & Features, June 23).The former  disgrace Jews and Israel, the latter dignify them.The reason  ultra-Orthodox Jews are called ultra-Orthodox is because they are extreme in  their treatment of women, relations to non-Jews and attitudes toward secular  culture and education.They are a fast-growing segment of the Jewish  population because of their high birth rate, not their fanaticism.Many  of my non-Jewish colleagues do not regard Israel as a country of dashing Jews in  a benighted Middle East, but as a Jewish Pakistan when they see haredim dressed  in black kaftans under a broiling Mediterranean sun forcing women to the back of  the bus. The ghetto garb is based on an obsession with distancing themselves as  much as possible from non-Jews and non-haredi Jews.Modern Orthodox Jews  believe in integrating Judaism with modernity and Zionism. In Israel, the writer  S.Y. Agnon and the mathematician Robert Aumann, both modern Orthodox Jews, won  Nobel Prizes. In addition, modern Orthodox rabbis are proud of their “Rabbi Dr.”  title because a PhD enhances a Jew.Not for them the absurdity of not  studying English, math and science.JACOB MENDLOVIC Toronto Cause and  effectIn “What hath Bernie wrought?” (Washington Watch, June 23), Douglas  Bloomfield draws parallels between Bernie Sanders and Ehud Barak. He purports  that they have parallel messages regarding the Netanyahu government’s “inflaming  passions and causing fear” and asserts that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is  “swinging Israel so far to the right that it is alienating young American  Jews.”Our current government, and several before, reflect the democratic  views of the majority of Israelis who came to understand the failures of Barak  and his liberal cohorts. Netanyahu is not leading us astray. He and his  coalition partners are fulfilling the will of middle Israelis who understand too  well that the desire for peace notwithstanding, it takes real partnership to  make it happen.Bloomfield also says that large chunks of American Jewry,  having become more American than Jewish and having assimilated in record  numbers, are losing their attachment to Israel.It is not Netanyahu or  Israeli lawmakers who are alienating America’s liberal Jews. It is the liberal  Jews’ rejection of tradition that has caused them to reject Israel.STEVE  SOLOMON Efrat Expense accountingI read with incredulity “Netanyahu spent NIS 2  million on residences – report” (June 20).However, the report fails to  mention that of the 1,300 receipts available under freedom of information laws,  220 were withheld, amounting to roughly half a million shekels.It was  claimed that revealing these documents would encroach upon the privacy of the  prime minister’s family. But if they were paid for by the state, the  information, as in any democratic country, should be released, or the prime  minister should reimburse the state accordingly.

<title>Letters to the Editor: Succinct summation</title>
<date>4/12/2016</date>
<content>
Succinct summationSometimes, the key to a situation can be expressed in one  sentence. In “UN report indicates next Arab implosion could be just around the  corner” (December 2), there is a quote from The Economist: “Arabs make up just  5% of the world’s population, but they account for about half the world’s  terrorism and refugees.”

GERRY MYERS
Beit Zayit




A lot of noiseDov  Lipman’s “A call to vote against the Muezzin law” (Frontlines, December 2) is a  bit strange.He spends three quarters of the article talking about his  personal experience with an Arab who wants to live a normal life in Israel and  be a law-abiding citizen – which is real nice. From there, he goes on to how  Israel should be respectful of Arab rights and their holy sites. At the end, he  makes a jump stating that Israel should not pass the so-called muezzin law  because it is not respectful of Arabs at prayer.Sorry, but Lipman is way  offbase, and his arguments for this cause – there aren’t really any – are  confusing. So let me fill him in on the reality of the situation.As  someone living over the “Green Line” for the past 14 years since my and my  family’s aliya, we have been disrupted several times a day on a daily basis to  the loud calling for prayers, which continues on and on for way too long over a  very loud loudspeaker. Like anything else, you get used to it throughout the  day. But when woken up in the very early hours only because we are guilty of  keeping windows open to enjoy some fresh Israeli air, we are punished. In many  cases, we lose our sleep for the night (not to mention little kids and babies  crying – and I won’t even address the health issues of sleep  deprivation).It’s a shame Lipman didn’t put his last paragraph at the  beginning and really delve into the issue. He makes a good point quickly – how  Israel should enforce existing noise laws. But I’m a bit tired of hearing that  every time Arabs need to be disciplined for doing something inappropriate or  against the law, we need to worry more about discrimination.If we keep  the story the same but change the characters, how would it play out? Israel on  loudspeakers for 10-12 minutes straight, calling and singing nonstop, though at  more sane hours and only three times a day. Suddenly, the police would enforce  the law; the Supreme Court would pass new laws against the very practice; the UN  would condemn Israel; and the international press would have a field day with  those “horrific Jewish practices” that are the “real” impediment to  peace.

PHYLLIS HECHT
HashmonaimIsraeli-Arab rabble-rousers who want to  fire up the Muslim world against Israel over the issue of allowing loudspeakers  on the minarets of mosques should know that religious rights are not absolute in  western democracies.Here in the province of Ontario, which includes  Toronto, religious-school apartheid is in effect: While Catholic schools through  high school are government-funded (this was enshrined in the constitution when  Canada became a country in 1867), Jews must pay through the nose for a Jewish  education.In the Outremont borough of Montreal, Hassidim are not only  constantly harassed by officials over issues ranging from the maintenance of a  succa to parked cars on Shabbat, they have had their right to build synagogues  sharply curtailed.In France and Belgium, the veil covering the faces of  Muslim women is banned; now Holland is proposing a partial ban. Imagine the  uproar if Israel dictated a dress code for Muslim women.

JACOB MENDLOVIC
TorontoBarak’s recordSo former prime minister Ehud Barak criticizes the  government’s handling of the “recent spate of fires” (“Barak indicates forming  new movement to take on PM,” November 30).One wonders how he would have  handled the catastrophic fires. Running in the other direction, perhaps, like he  did in 1992 during the disaster at the IDF’s Tze’elim training base? Leaving a  wounded Border Police sergeant to his fate at Joseph’s Tomb in October 2000?  Beating a hasty retreat from southern Lebanon in the same year? If these are  examples of how Barak deals with dangerous situations, the Israeli people would  be far better served if he returned to his business consulting and left the  governing to those elected to govern.

DAVID S. ADDLEMAN
Mevaseret ZionDeserves our gratitudeWith regard to Efraim Zuroff’s “More work to do on  Holocaust in Lithuania” (Comment & Features, November 29), I would suggest  that this would also apply to many other countries where the Nazis carried out  their murderous exploits both with and without the connivance of the local  population.It is now over 70 years since these tragic events occurred,  and as Zuroff mentions, the Lithuanian government appears indifferent to them  and the sanctity of any area where they occurred. I am afraid that as the years  go by, the Holocaust will become thought of by many as just another historical  event; therefore, it is vital that the message continually goes out around the  world, especially in those countries where these tragic events occurred and  where the Holocaust was a monumental event and a major blot on  humanity.We are the fortunate ones who lived to see and experience an  Israel for the Jewish people.Therefore, it is our duty and the duty of  future generations to keep alive the memory of those who were murdered, and to  ensure that Jewish cemeteries, wherever they may be, are kept as sacred  places.Persons such as Zuroff rightly deserve our gratitude for being at  the forefront in carrying out this mission.STEPHEN VISHNICK
Tel AvivWish listWith about a month and a half left until US President Barack Obama  leaves office, I would like to suggest that the time is ideal for Israel and the  Palestinian Authority to conclude a peace treaty. President-elect Donald Trump  is already in the process of dismantling Obama’s legacy, so for the first time  in his almost eight years in office, the president might be more flexible with  regard to his approach to settling this nagging problem.As far PA  President Mahmoud Abbas is concerned, it is crystal clear that he would get a  better settlement under Obama than under Trump. As far as Israel is concerned,  we have already seen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agree to a large defense  budget allocation from Obama because of the realization that any new  administration might come up short in helping Israel meet its needs. (It was  truly a wise decision on the part of the prime minister.) One thing, though, is  for sure: Our problems will go on the back burner until Trump makes America  great again and problems such as Obamacare, the Mexican wall and American  infrastructure are attended to. As we cool our heels, how many people will die  until the politicians get around to trying to settle our problems? Quiet,  behind-the-scenes negotiations are needed. I am sure that with all the necessary  preparation, a peace agreement could be reached within 10 days, with the rest of  the time spent having the proposal approved.Pie in the sky? Maybe. But  it is worth putting on my wish list.

<title>Letters to the Editor: Unfair decision</title>
<date>9/4/2016</date>
<content>
Unfair decisionI was saddened that the parole board rejected former president  Moshe Katsav’s request for release from prison after having served two-thirds of  his sentence, “Ex-president Katsav’s request for early parole denied,” April  7.




The rejection appears to have been based on the fact that he has  staunchly maintained his innocence, and because of pressure from women’s groups  that releasing him was against the interests of his alleged victims and would  not send a message of deterrence to others holding high office from committing  the same crime.Surely the fact that he has protested his innocence when  an admission and a false declaration of remorse might, indeed probably would,  have brought him early release, has to mean something.Strident feminists  may see an unrepentant sinner, but sister, I am no less a feminist and I see a  man sticking to his principles.During his time in prison Katsav has by  all accounts been a model prisoner. At 70, and clearly a broken man, he in no  way resembles the predatory rapist creeping up on an unsuspecting woman in a  dark alley.In fact there is no way that his early release could be  considered by any rational person a threat.So in spite of the much  vaunted equality before the law it is difficult to think that in fact Katsav  will have to serve out the rest of his sentence only because he is a former  president, a decision that is clearly unfair and, in my opinion,  vindictive.YEHUDIT COLLINS JerusalemCruel behavior The military  prosecution is investigating the Hebron soldier as the worst criminal and like a  terrorist. It is incomprehensible, that after the military court decided to  release this soldier from prison, and keep him free in a military basis, the  prosecution is appealing again and again against this decree.Why? There  is no plausible reason that this soldier will escape, or try to kill another  terrorist.So why this cruel behavior of military prosecution toward a  soldier, who until yesterday risked his life for defending the people of Israel?  The only sensible explanation I have for this eagerness of the prosecution is,  that they want to impress B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence and other left-wing  organizations, who surely applaud to this cruel behavior of the military  prosecution.I really wonder, to which degree the prosecution has adopted  the “values of B’Tselem” and its conducting of this investigation according to  their values and credo.B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence can record new  success in watching our so-called military prosecution’s behavior.These  organizations could not do it better than our military prosecutor.Mr.  Ya’alon, you should rather investigate these “laws and values” of your military  prosecution, who do – in my opinion – a very biased job.SHLOMO FELDMANN  GivatayimCrybabiesThe outcry about newly delivered mothers preferring to be in  wards with women of their own community “Smotrich supports hospital room  segregation between Jews and Arabs,” April 6, is not remotely related to  “apartheid.”As a woman who has given birth to several children in  Israeli government hospitals I can sympathize with the need for some quiet and  privacy in the first two days after giving birth.However the real  problem, which all the commentators seem to have missed, is that there are,  apparently, no formal approved visiting hours to protect patients, and shield  the newborns from the risk of multiple infections carried in off the street by  the general public.In other hospital departments, such as cardiac  intensive care, there seems to be little attempt to limit the many hours of  public access in crowded multi-occupancy wards. Today the situation is now made  worse by the nuisance of prolonged mobile phone conversations, and unlimited  numbers of visitors allowed to each patient.MEIRA FISHBURN JerusalemNot  the answerIn reference to Daniel Goldman’s article concerning the morals of  hospital segregation “Hospital segregation? Remember we were strangers in a  strange land,” April 7, some time ago, I went to visit a friend who had major  surgery on her knees.The other patient in the room was entertaining  people who had come to visit, and the noise level was deafening. My friend was  in a lot of pain and finally, she was moved to another room.Each patient  should have consideration for the other. But it is the hospital who should set  rules. They should only allow one or two visitors at a time for each patient and  the noise level must be reduced. That way no one suffers.Separating  different people is not the answer.SYLVIA WEISSMANN Jerusalem Stir it up Haven’t we got enough problems without having to make up others? Since the  National Insurance Institute pays for the birth, there has been a growing  competition between hospitals as to which one will provide the best  service.Therefore it’s imperative to let the mother choose how she wants  to give birth, and yes, what her preferences are after she has given  birth.Mothers are only in the hospital for about 48 hours and then they  go home to their family.But the real question is were there even any  Arab women complaining? I think not. MK Ahmad Tibi is just trying to stir things  up and MK Nachman Shai should know better than to fall for this  nonsense.FREYA BINENFELD Petah Tikva Love injection With regard to “I  stand with Israel” (Comment & Features, April 6), what an outstanding piece.  I laud and acknowledge writer Yonina Pritzker.What a wonderful injection  of support and love for what Israel is all about, especially at a time when so  many people, governments and even Jews are so biased against it. Most of them  have never lived here and never experienced the wonder and miracle of this  country. My heart cries for them! SHIRNA OSPOVAT Ashkelon On paper Regarding  your correction of March 27, thanks are due to The Jerusalem Post and legal  affairs reporter Yonah Jeremy Bob for being self-critical enough to reverse  errors in Mr. Bob’s March 9 report “Palestinians try to turn US courts on  Adelson, Abrams and anyone linked to settlements.”The original report  maintained that “US policy views settlements as illegal.” This was of course an  error. The article now correctly refers to “US administrations have...  characterized the settlements as illegitimate” etc.Second, Mr. Bob’s  March 9 story referred to “the two-state solution envisioned by UN Security  Council Resolution 242.”This also was an error since Resolution 242  makes no mention of any “two-state solution.”Since errors on  legal-diplomatic matters often dissipate and harm Israel, it is admirable that  The Jerusalem Post promptly corrected these errors. The Jerusalem Post was also  the only media organization to look into an allegation, widely publicized in  Israel and abroad in 2008, that “settlers threw acid at a policeman” in Hebron.  The Jerusalem Post was able to establish that this allegation had no basis in  fact.Such responsible media practices cannot be taken for  granted.Just weeks ago, Israel’s Government Press Office had to take a  far wealthier media organization – Time Magazine – to task for refusing to  correct a serious factual error. Hurrah then, for The Jerusalem  Post.SUSIE DYM Rehovot

<title>Letters to the editor: Witless fans</title>
<date>22/8/2016</date>
<content>
Witless fansWith regard to “Scottish soccer club to face charges over abundance  of Palestinian flags” (August 21), surely, the best punishment for the fans  would be to write out the “90 laws” that “discriminate against indigenous  Palestinians who make up 20 percent” of Israel’s population.




I, for one,  would love to know what they are.This list should then be sent to all  those poor Palestinians who make up so much of our population, asking them if  they would like to leave this “apartheid state” and live somewhere  else.I am sick of the lies that are fed to unsuspecting people who  haven’t the wit to go and check them.FREYA BINENFELD Petah TikvaLurid  headlineI have yet to see a more lurid headline than “Will Barak testify  against Netanyahu?” and sub-headline “MKs demand hearing after accusation that  PM harmed national security” (August 19).My immediate reaction was, Good  Lord, what has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu done to us? Has he given state  secrets to our enemies? Only when I read further did I see it was all due to a  simple a statement by former prime minister Ehud Barak, who, like former  president Shimon Peres, tends to run off at the mouth with unsubstantiated  accusations and extremely foolish prognostications.They are two very bad  “prophets” that Israel is burdened with! MICHA’EL S. BLOCH Kochav Yair Others  get more According to your Washington- based correspondent Michael Wilner (“US  Green party presidential candidate calls to end Israel aid,” August 19), Israel  receives more US foreign aid than any other country. Let me explain why this is  incorrect.The US has mutual protection treaties with 36 countries (NATO  and SEATO), and is obligated by treaty to come to their defense.Israel  is not a member of either organization, and has no such treaty with the  US.The only time a US president (Dwight D. Eisenhower) promised (in a  letter to then prime minister David Ben-Gurion) to protect Israeli interests, it  was to keep the Gulf of Aqaba open to Israeli shipping. But another US president  (Johnson) did not honor this commitment, consequently forcing Israel to attack  Egypt and begin the Six Day War.The US military has hundreds of  thousands of combat troops stationed in NATO and SEATO countries, including  Japan, South Korea, Germany and Turkey, and many more on ships throughout the  world. It does not have one combat soldier stationed in Israel.The US  military budget is $600 billion a year. Divide that budget by the 36 countries  in the treaty organizations, and note that each treaty member receives about  $17b. in US aid per year to stay under the umbrella of US protection. Compare  that to the $3b. a year Israel receives from the US.Is Israel really the  largest recipient of US aid?JOEL LEVINE Sunny Isles Beach, Florida Google it In  “Historians say Warsaw’s bill on ‘death camps’ extreme” (August 19), we learn  about Poland’s efforts to clarify that the death camps set up in Poland during  World War II were German, not Polish. These efforts draw attention to the record  of Polish anti-Semitism, which includes the Jedwabne pogrom, in which Jews were  burned alive during the Holocaust by their Polish neighbors.Readers  interested in current and historical Polish anti-Semitism can start their search  for information by googling “Polish anti-Semitism,” “Jedwabne,” “Wasosz” and  “Radzilow.”GERRY MYERS Beit Zayit Misleading claim Reuven Hammer (“Can  Israel teach American Jews about Jewish identity?” Observations, August 19)  writes that “since the vast majority of American Jews are not Orthodox, why is  it that two-thirds of the money is going to Orthodox groups, and none whatsoever  to the Conservative or Reform groups that represent the majority of organized  religious Jewry?” While the vast majority of American Jews are non-observant  and, in deed, indifferent to Jewish religious tradition, this does not mean they  have any commitment to non-Orthodox movements.Even Hammer’s clever  switch of terminology by referring to those he calls “organized religious Jewry”  is disingenuous in that the vast majority are “paper members” only, unlike the  Orthodox, who are regular participants in synagogue activities.If I am  not mistaken, their Jewish identity is so diluted that a majority of them are  marrying non-Jews who do not even go through the “conversions” their movements  provide. So though his first claim might well be true, the second is not, and it  is entirely – and possibly deliberately – misleading.MARTIN D. STERN  Salford, UK Transportation woes Following on the heels of Israel’s valiant  efforts at the Rio Olympics, one could be forgiven for thinking that our  national sport is judo. But one would be sadly mistaken, for it is surely our  famous free-style highway driving.The rules are simple and strictly  adhered to by all competitors.One gets behind the wheel of the most  powerful and largest vehicle affordable, and sets off at breakneck speed in an  effort to reach a destination in the shortest possible time. A total absence of  any policing on our roads enables and facilitates all participants to freely  engage in any maneuver that will hinder, impede, delay or otherwise hold back  any other car in the immediate vicinity. A prerequisite for success is an innate  ability not to anticipate any threat of danger.Such a shame that there  is, as yet, no official designation for this sport in the Olympics. If there  were, we Israelis would take gold every time! DAVID S. ADDLEMAN Mevaseret ZionI  just came back from London, where I was very impressed with the public  transportation system, especially the speed of getting on and off  buses.The driver does not take money, which means a great savings of  time in not having to give tickets and change to those who have no card. To get  on the bus, a visitor has to have an Oyster card, which can be bought at many  shops.Nobody is allowed to get off at the front of the bus, which means  people can get on straight away and place their card on a magnetic plate without  stopping.Compare this to our system – we have delays waiting for people  who like to get off at the front, where the doors are so narrow.I am  also amazed at Egged’s 947 line to Jerusalem, and how many people give the  driver large notes for a single fare. Multiply this on most buses around Israel  and you can see how much time and money we could save.W. MALKINSON  Ra’anana I enjoy using the train service.But it’s always a hassle to  arrive at Jerusalem’s Malha station. There aren’t any buses, and the few taxis  that wait outside have drivers who are rude and uncooperative, and generally  won’t take you anywhere unless you live far enough away to make the ride  lucrative.I have no intention to please the taxi drivers by moving  house, but why should I have to hike to the Malha shopping mall to get a taxi  home? RAYMOND APPLE Jerusalem CORRECTIONS• The mayor of Sderot is Alon Davidi,  and not as stated in “Rocket hits Sderot, Israel responds with planes, tanks”  (August 22).

<title>Letters to the Editor: Wrong on USSR</title>
<date>5/3/2016</date>
<content>
Wrong on USSR In “Propping up the paper tiger: How the West creates the  self-fulfilling prophecy of militant Iran” (Comment & Features, March 3),  Irina Tsukerman makes the case that the West is greatly overestimating the  economic strength and eventual viability of the Iranian theocratic  regime.




In her opening sentence, she states: “How would the West have  conducted itself during the Cold War had it known in 1945, 1970 or even 1985  what we know now – that the Soviet Union was a paper tiger...? She is quite  wrong about 1985.When Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981, he was  determined to change US Cold War strategy from that of “containment” or  “detente” to that of winning. His initial national security adviser, Richard  Allen, appointed a staff that devoted the following two years to devising a  grand strategy to achieve this goal, including all the elements of statecraft:  diplomacy, propaganda, economics, subversion and military power.In  January 1983, National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 75 was issued by the  White House in which the grand strategy was set forth in detail.Five  years later, the Soviet bloc collapsed, and two years after that, the Soviet  Union itself fell apart.I was a member of that team.In 1998,  when the official documents had been declassified, I published the monograph The  Strategic Plan that Won the Cold War. Inspired by that publication, the book The  Grand Strategy that Won the Cold War: Architecture Of Triumph, written in part  by several of the people involved in the preparation of the strategic plan, has  just been published.The Soviet empire did not fall because of feebleness  or because it stumbled over a rock. It was pushed. The author of its demise was  not Mikhail Gorbachev, but Ronald Reagan.NORMAN A. BAILEY Zichron  Ya’acov The writer is a professor of economics and national security at the  University of Haifa’s National Security Studies Center and was a special  assistant for national security affairs to US president Ronald  Reagan.Waze dazeWith regard to “IDF: We don’t blame Waze for Kalandiya  gun battle” (March 2), Waze has a setting to avoid “dangerous areas.”  Unfortunately, the single setting has a number of pitfalls.With it off,  Waze once told me there was no way to go to Har Bracha. With it on while coming  back from Har Bracha on a Saturday night, Waze decided to route me through the  middle of Ramallah! At least Google Navigate (part of Google Maps) seems to know  the difference! SIMON KAHN Jerusalem 

Hopes it works Efforts to revive the peace  plan put forward in 2002 by Saudi Arabia (“Think tank seeks to revive Arab Peace  Initiative,” March 2) should be widely welcomed.The fact that there has  been no official Israeli response to this initiative throughout the years is  hard to comprehend. It is interesting to note that the Arab League has shown  flexibility in past years on issues related to land swaps between Israel and the  Palestinians, and on the need for an agreed-upon solution to the refugee  issue.May the initiative to revive that initiative prove successful!ZEEV RAPHAEL HaifaJNF and BDSCaroline B. Glick hits the bullseye in “Time to  draw the lines and defend them” (Our World, March 2).Knowing when to  draw the lines on fundamental principles and defend them is a truism that our  Jewish leaders are often slow to learn. Ms. Glick provides several examples of  how the violation of this principle has led to the BDS movement. But one can go  back even farther in tracing this political headache.In the 1980s, the  US Internal Revenue Service threatened to revoke the tax-exempt status of the  Jewish National Fund if it provided services to areas of the “West Bank” (Judea  and Samaria), which the US has regarded as “occupied territory.”For  pragmatic reasons, such as avoiding the loss of potential donors who might  refrain from contributing to the JNF if the IRS disallowed charitable  deductions, the quasi-governmental organization acquiesced to the  demand.The political backlash resulting from this concession was  irreparable.Judea and Samaria became the target of international  challenges to Israel’s sovereignty over our biblical heartland. Had the JNF  stood firm and insisted that the area was as integral a part of Israel as was  Tel Aviv and Haifa, BDS might never have arisen.ROBERT DUBLIN Jerusalem  Totally mystifying The shortsightedness of our government regarding the 74  Palestinian workers at SodaStream (“SodaStream CEO slams government’s ‘disregard  for human dignity’ over lapsed Palestinian work permits,” March 1) is deeply  disturbing.Over 100,000 Palestinian workers are allowed daily to enter  Israel. Why the 74, who have been forged into goodwill ambassadors, should be  deprived of the unique opportunity to create a “bridge of peace” is totally  mystifying.This policy shows an abundance of callousness, lack of  sensitivity and total disregard of Israel’s status among the nations. It  presents an image of incomparable stupidity, stunning in the midst of our  people, when an unparalleled example of Israel not being an “apartheid state” is  being cast aside.Ultimately, it shows a desperate need to revamp the  electoral system to make our representatives responsive to our needs and wishes,  rather than having us remain crawling, subordinate minions in the clutches of  their masterful, all-powerful parties whose selfish interests take precedence  over the interests of the nation.Perhaps someone in our leadership will  awaken to rectify a blunder that cries out to the high heavens.ERVIN  BIRNBAUM Netanya The writer, a retired rabbi and professor of political science,  is father of Sodastream CEO Daniel Birnbaum.Ignoramus authors In  response to “Michael Chabon, Ayelet Waldman to edit book on ‘Israeli  Occupation’” (Arts & Entertainment, February 22), once again,  Jewish-American ignoramuses have the chutzpah to claim that Israel is occupying  a land called “Palestine” and are preparing to write a book on what they  ignorantly and spitefully claim as being “50 years of the Israeli  Occupation.”How can it be that educated people are ignorant of the fact  that the royal tribe of Judah (and other Israelite tribes), led by their  patriarch, Abraham, some 4-5,000 years ago, entered the land that God had  promised would be theirs for eternity, no matter how many times it might fall  into the hands of their enemies? No other nation has had any claim upon this  promised land, no matter how long they might have been able to occupy  it.I suggest that Chabon and Waldman read A Century of Dishonor on the  dreadful treatment dished out to native Americans by millions of ruthless  foreigners who came mainly from Europe.TRUDY GEFEN Kiryat OnoGone to  the birds It appears that the Arabs have successfully harnessed the east wind  that recently was blowing so strongly over Israel.On a recent morning,  as I sat on my balcony, I noticed the birds being blown out of their perches  toward the sea. They managed to nestle lower down in the trees, and after a  rest, these stalwart Zionists regained the heights and settled once more in  their nests.We can expect nothing good coming from the east since Joshua  brought the children of Israel over the Jordan so many years ago. My conclusion  is that despite the Arabs’ attempts to drive us into the sea, their efforts have  gone to the birds!

<title>March 8th: What’s Biden want?</title>
<date>7/3/2016</date>
<content>
What’s Biden want?US Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive in Israel  today. What is his purpose in coming now? Will he speak out for Israelis and  tell the Palestinians that they will cause World War III? I am sure that this  will not be his message. Perhaps he will propose a gateway or peace park with  new kinds of relationships between Ramallah and Beit El to herald a “new era.”  However, our reality leaves the purpose of his visit suspect to thoughts that  he’ll pressure Israel once again to further President Barack Obama’s dream of  two states here in this small Land of Israel.




This is totally  unrealistic, and at this time it could only be a land of Iranian penetration. I  pray that Mr. Biden comes with a different message than the one I fear. TOBY  WILLIG
Jerusalem A democracy’s dutyWith regard to “Suspending democracy”  (Editorial, March 6), it is more than disconcerting that your views totally  ignore the reality and uniqueness of Israel’s position.The tiny country  parented by the unanimous support of the League of Nations in 1922, and a  two-thirds majority of the United Nations in 1947, has been under constant  attack by many of its neighbors. Not a single one of these neighbors is a real  democracy, rather the reverse – there is little or no freedom of speech,  equality of sexes, freedom of religion or political dissent there.By  attacking us, our enemies – both external and internal – are attacking democracy  itself .We must compare ourselves with the US and UK as they were in  times of war, because our enemies will try again to destroy us if they feel they  have a chance of success. We must follow the advice of Abraham Lincoln, who  stated in 1859: “Those who deny freedom to others do not deserve it for  themselves.” And the advice of Marcus Tullius Cicero from over 2,000 years ago:  “A Nation cannot survive treason from within. The traitor moves within the gates  freely. His sly whispers, rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very  halls of government itself.”Our authorities have a right – factually, a  duty – to exclude from the halls of power, whether elected or otherwise, those  who by word or deed support enemies who are intent upon our destruction. A  democracy’s first duty is to defend itself against those who wish to destroy it.  BERNHARD LAZARUS
Tel Aviv SodaStream fizzMy sincere thanks to Sherwin Pomerantz  for his clearly expressed (and perfectly headlined) “SodaStream: Case study in  Middle East insanity” (Comment & Features, March 6), and to The Jerusalem  Post for its March 4 editorial “Message in a bottle.” Thanks also to Daniel  Birnbaum and SodaStream for their fight against the Prime Minister’s Office and  all those civil servants for their inhuman and, in fact, utterly stupid refusal  to renew the work permits of 74 Palestinian employees.I thought I was  going insane with frustration at what Israel has been doing to  itself.SodaStream has been a shining example of coexistence between  Israelis and Palestinians, giving its employees absolutely excellent and equal  conditions of work and pay, and building up a spirit of respect and cooperation  in a way that can only be for the utmost good of all Israelis and  Palestinians.For the Prime Minister’s Office to hide behind its decision  as being simply technical in nature, and to carry out the policy of maintaining  a strict quota of some 60,000 Palestinians to work in Israel, ignores the fact  that these are not Palestinians who are applying for first-time entry, but tried  and trusted people who have proved themselves and cannot in any way be accused  of being a danger to the country.Expelling them is not only a callous  and inhumane blow to them and their families – it reinforces the Palestinian  view of us as a racist and dominant occupying authority. It will certainly  damage our image enormously.Instead of applauding what SodaStream has  been doing for that image, we are castigating and treating it as though it is  doing wrong and in some way helping the BDS campaign. In actual fact, it is the  government that is hurting us, and I believe it is being utterly stupid in doing  so.I wish we could have a lot more SodaStreams and people like Daniel  Birnbaum. HARRY BRODIE
Herzliya I have been speaking to Jewish friends in the  United States over how they see the SodaStream situation. Almost to a person,  they think it shows yet again the fumbling, ineffective responses taken by the  Israeli government in the face of the delegitimization of this  country.The government had the perfect opportunity for positive public  relations, showing that it valued Palestinian economic opportunities and  outreach by an Israeli business. And it blew it over just 74 jobs – which would  not make a dent in the thousands of Palestinian work permits already in  force.And in the name of what? National security? Jobs for Israelis? It  all rings hollow. And embarrassing.When is this bureaucracy going to use  the brains in its head instead of the foot in its mouth? JAN GAINES
Netanya  Employment for Beduin in the Negev or other Israeli Arabs is an example of  Israel giving opportunities to its own minorities, and belies the apartheid  myth.Nothing is accomplished by employing tens of thousands of  Palestinians who resent us as employers and have never exerted any influence on  their leadership to arrive at a solution that would give a better future to all.  They resent working for Israelis and wait for the opportunity to take it all for  their own. ZVI FINK 
Modi’in Winning pointsI read with great interest Dov  Lipman’s “How Israel will win the public diplomacy war” (Observations, March 4).  However, he missed two very important points.The Arab/Palestinian  narrative is very simple. They say that the Jews have taken their land. Our  usual answer is (in a nutshell) that we are prepared to compromise, but our  security must be maintained. This answer puts us immediately on the defensive,  and millions of people in Europe and America believe the Arab  narrative.The first point we must make is that it is written in the  Bible that God gave us this very small country. We had a kingdom here for  hundreds of years, 1,500 years before the birth of Islam. The Bible is still the  most widely published book, and these facts can easily be checked. The world is  waiting for us to make this statement. If we don’t say it, nobody will say it  for us.The second point is the Balfour Declaration. It was subsequently  endorsed by the League of Nations. It became international law. Fifty-one  countries approved the recommendation.These two points should be  mentioned on every possible occasion. We have both the Bible and international  law to prove our right to this land, and for some reason, our government is  afraid to say these things. It’s about time we turned the tables.We are  actually the only people who have legal rights to this land. Somehow these  points are regarded as right-wing extremism. I believe that these points,  together with Lipman’s article, could bring us good diplomacy.

<title>McGill University attempts peaceful dialogue hindered by protest</title>
<date>30/11/2016</date>
<content>
The reason McGill University spoke to me so much was because of its emphasis on  the importance of free speech and self-expression. Coming from France, I often  found I was not given a platform to express my support of Israel and was  silenced by the necessity to prioritize my safety. Here, I was in a safe space,  where my differences were not only embraced, but appreciated... or so I  thought.Over the past year and a half, I found myself disappointed by  the relentless hatred that has brought three anti-Israel divestment resolutions  to our campus over a two-year period. After all the ignorance and blind  accusations I encountered, I decided that I wanted to learn more, and  participate in fruitful conversations rather than passively witnessing a lot of  hateful slogans thrown around. Therefore, I became a StandWithUs Canada Emerson  Fellow, and have been given the tools and the facts to initiate those dialogues.  The question remains, when will they happen at McGill? On November 8, I brought  a program to McGill that I thought best represented the vibrant, spontaneous and  optimistic nature that I experienced upon visiting Israel. I wanted to expose  Israel – creative, multi-ethnic, inclusive and sometimes messy – to my friends  and peers. Artists 4 Israel was the perfect vehicle. I wanted to use art as a  platform to engage in meaningful and constructive conversations, that would help  others develop a better understanding about a country that is too often wrongly  criticized and misrepresented.




I wanted students to learn about Israeli  culture and that it is a democracy with respect for all minorities – especially  its 20 percent Arab population – who have full rights (including serving as the  presidents of academic institutions, members of the Supreme Court and the  Knesset).Soon enough, this event – one that so desperately tried to set  aside political differences to share our common desire for peace – attracted  negative attention from angry anti-Israel students on campus. They unfurled  banners, elicited hateful slogans, and physically trapped us behind their  sheets. Some of these individuals even interviewed us, before putting away their  note pads and joining the crowd.These same students reported about the  event in the school newspaper, The McGill Daily. The biased article distorts our  goals and further misrepresents Israel.As pro-Israel students on campus,  we never imagined that an art exhibit intended to convey coexistence, diversity,  culture and peace would become a flashpoint for an anti-Israel demonstration.  Given the open-minded and safe-space approach taken, maybe now it’s time to  question the real motives.We can’t deny the facts: if the mural had been  brought by any other culture club on campus, it would have never seen the  opposition that it was subjected to. Various organizations present events to  share their cultures, and introduce the community to some of the wonderful  differences that make McGill so unique. In early November, the McGill Mexican  Student Association (MMSA) brought an event to celebrate El Dia De Los Muertos,  which had a great turnout and highly positive response.So how did we get  to a point that when pro-Israel students bring an event to campus – even in the  most peaceful of scenarios – they can’t display a flag that brings us so much  pride in representing our democratic values, without experiencing such strong  opposition and backlash? The facts are that in the McGill Daily article (which  touts itself as representing the voices of students), the art installation about  Tel Aviv graffiti was labeled as an “insensitive concept and erasure of  Palestinian voices.” To me, this is beyond belief.The fact is that the  violent silencing and blocking of this event is what should be considered  insensitive, and an erasure of Jewish and Israeli voices.The protesters  were unhappy about the fact that “ Palestinian people, along with any  Palestinian flags or symbols, were entirely absent from the event.” Yes, that is  absolutely correct. This was a display about Israel. It was not designed to be a  political statement. It was a display of the art of Israel’s  streets.Seriously? Comparing an art exhibit to what they call “an  apartheid wall” is ridiculous.Once again, it distorts and misrepresents,  and in the end was simply their effort to deny Jewish and Israeli students the  right to free speech in sharing their perception of Israel with their fellow  students.This experience shed light on a very upsetting reality – their  problem is with the sheer presence of Israel, and not the dialogue or message it  tries to promote. The fact that they protested a display calling for peace just  because it had something to do with Israel is precisely this type of intolerance  that hinders efforts to resolve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians  on the ground.We are no longer talking about political disagreements,  given that this installation negated this. The issue is much more  worrying.Now, we are talking about a fundamental disrespect for a  difference of opinion.It is precisely this type of intolerance that  results in these ugly attempts to silence any voices except those of McGill  Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR). We object strongly  to the kind of partisanship that would result in the views of only one group  being heard – and we object strongly to the characterization of this article,  which seems to condone this kind of intolerant, and borderline racist  behavior.The author is a sophomore at McGill University in Montreal,  Canada majoring in biochemistry.

<title>Media Comment: ‘Haaretz’ vs. Bennett</title>
<date>2/3/2016</date>
<content>
In our consumer-driven society, a privately  owned newspaper has the right to advocate the views of its editors and  publishers. The consumer who does not like the editorial line or, better, the  party line, is free to purchase other newspapers. But freedom of expression is  not freedom of vilification. A media outlet which respects itself should allow  even villains the right of reply and the ability to defend their good  name.Haaretz doesn’t act that way. When it decides to latch onto  someone, it does so with no holds barred, cruelly, bitterly and decidedly  unethically. This is so in the case of Haaretz vs. Bennett.




The party  line of Haaretz is liberal, extreme left-wing but fiscally conservative.  Education Minister Naftali Bennett is perceived as a threat, especially to the  first two characteristics. Under his leadership, his Bayit Yehudi party is  changing some of the most important strongholds of the elites, and they are  screaming, with Haaretz leading the pack.It is no secret that the  academic elite in Israel identify mostly with the secular, left-wing liberal  community.They are avid consumers of Haaretz and Bennett is threatening  their hegemony. Israel spends many billions of shekels on higher education.  Policies are implemented through “Malag,” the Council for Higher Education, and  the funding goes through “Vatat,” the Coordination and Budget Committee. The  education minister is, by law, the chair of Malag and he appoints the chair of  Vatat.In practice, the vice-chair of Malag is the person responsible for  its day-to-day management since the minister does not have the time needed (nor  perhaps the expertise) to run the affairs of Malag on such a  basis.Professor Hagit Messer-Yaron, a professor of electrical  engineering at Tel Aviv University, served as the vicechair from October 2013  until February 2016. Bennett forced her resignation. Although he did not  publicize his reasons, one can fairly well guess what they were: Messer-Yaron  led an effort to neutralize the powers of the education minister to implement  the minister’s policies and to oversee academia.Briefly, the Commission  for Regulation of Governance which she headed recommended that the members of  Malag be appointed through an independent committee, chaired by a Supreme Court  justice. The academic community applauded as this would assure their domination  of academia. The forced resignation of Messer-Yaron put an end to  this.Haaretz is understandably concerned. So it permitted Professor  Moshe Shoked, professor emeritus of anthropology at Tel Aviv University, to  write an op-ed article entitled “In Our Very Own Weimar Republic” on February  19. In it, Shoked berates his colleagues and attacks Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu who, he said, is “the unrestrained, deceptive magician who grew up in  the home of a historian but was trained to enlist and promote ignorance, fear  and hatred in Israeli society.”He saves, however, his harshest remarks  for Benett, “whose conduct is a reminder of dark regimes of other periods” and  who wears a “pistol on his waist.”He ends his article by describing  Israel as “a society...that in practice is moving toward an apartheid  regime” and asks: “How can we remain passive in an era that is our equivalent of  the happy days of Weimar?” When people in the Gaza Strip, who were threatened  and in fact then expelled from their homes, wore a yellow star as a  demonstrative act, the media hanged them in the public square. But Haaretz is  allowed to publish an article which effectively accuses a minister of Nazi-like  behavior, and no one considers this a serious issue. Indeed, Haaretz knows that  Shoked has a habit of demeaning the Holocaust. He previously did so in a Haaretz  op-ed on March 11, 2011, “No to Boycott, Yes to Suicide,” reacting to a Knesset  bill which would forbid boycotting Israeli academic institutions, writing, “it  is hard not to recall the 1930s and 1940s, when another great nation took its  own life under a mad vision of border expansion.”Bennett has a number of  additional “sins” for which he need atone. These include the decision of his  ministry not to place the book Borderlife by Dorit Rabinian on the list of  compulsory reading for the matriculation exam in literature. If a student wants  to she or he can include it, but it is not an integral part of the  curriculum.Haaretz was incensed. In an editorial on January 1 it wrote:  “The backing of Minister Bennett [for the decision on the book] is another step  in the nationalistic indoctrination that the heads of the education ministry are  providing for the secular public school system.”But even this was not  enough. The paper went so far as to publish a letter to the editor by author  Amos Ben-Vered on February 2, who describes his childhood experience in a German  school in Bulgaria in 1938.Although the school was German and its  teachers wore the swastika, the curriculum remained as it was in pre-Nazi  Germany. Ben-Vered writes: “The question is how does the government and,  especially Minister Bennett, want to act? Are they willing at least to accept  the moderate spirit of the Nazi [Konstantin] von Neurath who permitted the  schools to teach as in previous years, when Germany was a democracy?” On the  Haaretz website, the letter comes with a picture of the Nazi von Neurath. The  equation, Bennett is a Nazi, speaks for itself.This is not to say that  Haaretz was not taken to task.On February 26, journalist Erel Segal  criticized the paper in an article published in Makor Rishon and the NRG  website. The story related that: “As long as Minister Bennett worried about the  number of children in the class, adding helping teachers and increasing math  lessons, it worked not too badly. But when he dared to touch core issues of our  existence here, the left went berserk. What was permitted to [former education  ministers Yuli] Tamir and [Yossi] Sarid is forbidden for the  right.”After describing outrageous acts by previous left-wing education  ministers, he ends by noting: “For me at least, the story is clear. There is no  danger to democracy, there is no fascism. There is here an elite struggling for  its hegemony. A paranoid and frightened elite unwilling to accept the fact that  the government of Israel, chosen by a majority which believes in Zionism,  decided to act accordingly.”Segal was not alone, but the mainstream  media remained silent. The talk shows, the radio programs, the TV news shows,  all of which were very quick to decry any allusions of the Left to Stalinism or  Nazism, said nothing.They did not call upon the Israel Democracy  Institute or the president of the Press Council, former Supreme Court justice  Dalia Dorner, to express their opinion on Haaretz’s articles. They did not  request a response from President Reuven Rivlin or Knesset speaker  Edelstein.No, they were silent, quiet accomplices of a newspaper which  is a blight to our society.

<title>My Word: Cinema verité and calling the shots</title>
<date>28/7/2016</date>
<content>
I need to start with an apology – not to those who might be offended by what I’m  about to write, but for not writing it earlier.The idea for this column  was born two weeks ago, when I first heard of the trip made by a group of Jews –  most of them from the Diaspora – who traveled to Hebron on a Friday to sing  feel-good songs and clear the ground around abandoned buildings with the idea of  constructing a cinema for the local residents – well, the Palestinian local  residents, at least.




Following a long chain of Facebook comments on a  +972 Magazine feature, it is obvious that Jewish residents of Hebron would not  be welcome, or safe, in the darkened movie theater if it ever gets off the  ground.I’m not sure Palestinian residents would be safe either, Hebron  being a Hamas stronghold. The cinema culture that once flourished in Gaza ended  when the Muslim Brotherhood affiliate ousted Fatah following Israel’s pullout in  2005.I postponed writing the column because the Nice ramming attack in  which more than 80 people were killed was more on my mind than a small group of  people spouting civil rights movement slogans and purportedly carrying a message  of “tikkun olam.” (I doubt most of them understand the concept. Labeling  and libeling the Jewish state an apartheid entity while demanding Palestinian  areas be judenrein is not “mending the world.”) This week has not been much  better with the ongoing attacks in Germany and the blood-chilling murder of an  elderly priest as he conducted morning mass in a small church in northern  France.(There have been other atrocities, but most of them fell off the  Western radar, being carried out by Islamists in places ranging from Pakistan to  Somalia. Attacks by jihadists on Christians in Africa and throughout the Middle  East are so commonplace they barely get mentioned – one of the reasons people  were so shocked when this type of attack was carried out in Europe.) There was  something farcical in what the cameras filming the cinema construction team  captured. A Jewish Press report included video footage, provided by local Jewish  resident Tzipi Shlisel, in which a Palestinian man claims that the ground is  used for grazing and belongs to him.Both claims are being disputed, but  he doesn’t seem to want Cinema Hebron opening near him soon.This didn’t  stop Peter Beinart, who had a cameo role at the Friday protest, from opening a  July 19 opinion piece in Haaretz: “Jawad Abu Aisha owns a cluttered yard in H2,  the sector of Hebron that falls under direct Israeli control. He’d like to turn  it into a cinema. Many local Palestinians – lacking recreational opportunities –  would like to help him. But Abu Aisha says that Jewish settlers, and the Israeli  military, prevent him from developing the space.”In the op-ed titled,  “What I Saw Last Friday in Hebron,” Beinart says he joined 52 Jewish activists  on the trip “organized by the Center for Jewish Nonviolence and the  anti-occupation collective, All That’s Left.We came at the request of a  group called Youth Against Settlements. It’s [sic] burly, charismatic leader, a  student of Gandhi and Martin Luther King named Issa Amro, asked Diaspora Jews to  come and help clear Abu Aisha’s yard. He didn’t need American Jewish muscle. He  needed American Jewish privilege, the privilege that gives American Jews  protection from the Israeli state... He also hoped it would bring them  publicity.”A few paragraphs and a lot of clichés later, Beinart admits  he doesn’t think this type of protest will have a direct impact on  Israelis.“The protests are too American,” he writes.“....But the  protests aren’t meant to change Israeli opinion. They’re meant to change  American Jewish opinion, which could in turn change American government  policy.And curiously, it was the very Americanism of the protest that  made it so Jewish.”So much for democracy. Those Israelis don’t know  what’s best for them, so we’ll force them to change their minds.The  sight of Israeli and American flags being burned by pro-Palestinian activists  outside the Democratic convention this week and the speeches coming out of the  Republican gathering did nothing to reassure most Israelis.Beinart  asserts he “spent the day fearing Jewish soldiers and police” and being  protected by the Palestinians as he worked alongside them.As he  celebrated a Kabbalat Shabbat, welcoming the Sabbath, surrounded by Palestinian  activists, I don’t suppose he considered the possibility that the Jewish (and  probably also Druse) soldiers and police were risking their lives to protect all  of them.Israeli actor and peace activist Juliano Mer Khamis, 52, who ran  a drama project in Jenin, was shot dead by masked men in 2011 near the theater  he founded, following many threats on his life from Islamists.When I  mentioned in the +972 Magazine comments section on Facebook that a cinema just  for Palestinians “doesn’t sound like something that could further peace,” I was  predictably attacked with the words “occupation,” “racist” and “Zionist  bitch.”I take the “Zionist” part as a compliment.I don’t have  the looks or the talent of Gal Gadot but at least I share the pride of the  Israeli actress, who faced far more public and more vicious talkbacks and tweets  than I did this week.Gadot – a former Miss Israel, supermodel, and IDF  combat trainer to boot – is the new Wonder Woman.Rather than judging it  on the screenplay, plot or acting, there are those who want to boycott the movie  because the star is an Israeli.Gadot, more than just a pretty face, says  that IDF service taught her useful Wonder Woman skills.Beinart calls the  American Jewish activists “formidable” and “brave,” and says they gave him  hope.There’s a Hebrew phrase for that: “Hai beseret.” He’s “living in a  movie,” a fantasy world.So is the Palestinian Authority whose foreign  minister Riyad al-Maliki, on behalf of President Mahmoud Abbas, presented the  Arab League this week with a request to help prepare a file to prosecute the  British for the 1917 Balfour Declaration.Too bad they can’t find any  Jebusites to sue for losing Jerusalem to King David.If Abbas can’t  accept the idea of a Jewish homeland, how is he meant to seriously negotiate a  peace agreement with the Jewish state? Building bridges is good. Normalizing  relations is better. Admitting that neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis  are going away is essential.I know a Palestinian journalist from  Ramallah who visited Jerusalem’s Cinema City before me, but is too scared of the  response of other Palestinians to publish her experience.
Forget waiting  for the fat lady to sing: There won’t be peace until Palestinian cinemas can  screen a movie starring Gal Gadot – and Jews and Palestinians will be safe  watching it, noshing popcorn in the dark together.

<title>My word: Diplomatic offensives</title>
<date>28/1/2016</date>
<content>
In different circumstances, I could have been a national heroine – in  Greenland.My family and I occasionally amuse ourselves listing various  countries and peoples seeking independence or involved in a territorial dispute  of some kind. The list seems to get longer each time.




A few months ago I  wrote as an aside in a column titled “Larger than life”: “When was the last time  you heard a public discussion on the right of Denmark to control Greenland, for  instance?” I began to fantasize about the small – but in my case life-size –  statue erected in my honor in the capital, Nuuk. Greenland’s  liberator.The dreams soured when I realized that although Greenland (or  Kalaallit Nunaat as it is known to locals) is the largest island in the world  that is not a continent, it is not somewhere I’d feel at home. Given that I  shudder at the thought of a brief Jerusalem-style snowstorm, don’t speak  Greenlandic (any of the three main dialects), and avoid fish and meat in my  diet, I’m not the person to lead the 57,000-or-so population to full liberation,  should they so choose.My plans were modest in any case, no violence  being the primary requisite. I thought I could start with renaming Denmark  School, the high school near my home, sticking to sunny climes and times as far  as possible.As soon as he read my comment in September, the pleasant and  polite Danish Ambassador Jesper Vahr wrote a letter clarifying that “Greenland’s  status within the Kingdom of Denmark has evolved over time. For many years now  Greenland has exercised wide-ranging legislative and executive powers on the  basis of an Act on Greenland Self-Government....However, there is no  doubt about Greenland’s access to independence, were the people of Greenland to  desire that at some point. Any decision regarding Greenland’s independence shall  be taken by the people of Greenland.”I understand why he was quick to  respond.Fifty years ago, nobody had heard of the Palestinians as a  people and yet here we are: Israeli Jews perceived as colonial usurpers;  mandated sessions at the UN on their situation throughout the year; and  permanent refugee status. Today you can meet “refugees” whose families have  lived in the same homes for decades, in many cases just a few miles from the  houses they fled (often at their own leaders’ insistence) during the chaos of  the wars the Arab countries launched on Israel in an attempt to destroy  it.One of Greenland’s sad claims to fame is its status as the teenage  suicide capital of the world. Apparently it’s a function of the climate and has  nothing to do with Danish oppression, real or imaginary. Neither do Greenland’s  youth try to kill innocent people with the intention of being shot dead and  dying a martyr’s death. That’s a peculiarly Palestinian/Islamist thing, it  seems.Not long ago, I accidentally upset the Spanish ambassador, who  like his Danish peer was quick to correct any misunderstandings that might have  arisen in a column I wrote on the European Union labeling policy (“Clued in,”  November 6): “Nobody is forced to buy a product labeled ‘Made in Israel’ just as  no one need buy produce marked ‘Made in Spain’ if they feel uncomfortable about  Spanish disputed territories such as the Basque region, Barcelona, or even  Gibraltar for that matter,” I wrote.“I was surprised to read the Basque  region and Barcelona described as ‘disputed territories,’” countered the envoy,  Fernando Carderera.Carderera clarified: “Both the Basque region, or  Basque country, as it is known in Spanish, and Barcelona have been part of Spain  since its origin... Both the Basque country and Catalonia enjoy, thanks to the  Spanish Constitution of 1978, one of the highest levels of self-government in  the world....“Gibraltar is a colony and, indeed, disputed territory,” he  noted and after further explanation added: “Spain has repeatedly asked the UK to  engage in bilateral negotiations in compliance with the provisions of the UN in  order to reach a definitive solution to the only remaining colony in  Europe.”I don’t want to add to the diplomatic headaches, but in one of  the most curious territorial disputes, out of some 150, “The UK, Iceland and  Denmark (Greenland) all assert ownership of Rockall Island, an 8,000 square foot  rock in the middle of the North Atlantic, hundreds of miles from the nearest  inhabited location,” according to metrocosm.com, claiming to map every disputed  territory in the world.I have also called for Kurdish independence,  based on the Kurds being a people with their own unique language, history and  culture, apart from the fact that they have courageously borne the brunt of the  fight on the ground against Islamic State forces.There was no Turkish  ambassador in Israel to respond, but it’s no secret how Turkey feels about the  subject. Still, with my nonviolence requirement in mind and the fact that the  Kurds are finding it hard to overcome their own considerable infighting,  independence is not on the horizon.I’d also like to see the Roma receive  some kind of homeland and rights. While Europe agonizes over its policy toward  refugees from the Middle East and Africa, the Roma live among them, and have  done for centuries, in terrible conditions. According to the European Roma  Rights Centre, five Romani children died in Slovakia in the first week of  January as a result of either the cold or fires in their inadequate and unsafe  housing. (And if any people can identify with the Jews on International  Holocaust Remembrance Day it must surely be the “gypsies.” The Nazis tried  systematically to not only eradicate them as a people but also destroy any  memory of them.) High on my list for UN recognition is Taiwan, the Republic of  China, a tiny but feisty democracy and economic powerhouse, considered by its  giant neighbor to be a province of the People’s Republic.China continues  to hold Tibet, but the world continues to do business with it and hold major  sporting events there. The BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement that  viciously inflates anything that could blacken Israel as an “apartheid state”  ignores human-rights travesties elsewhere.There are Muslim ethnic groups  persecuted by Buddhists in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand among other places,  but this is so far from what modern liberals want to see or believe that the  harassment gets scant attention in the Western world.If you can’t blame  the Jews, it’s not news.I’m not looking to add to the list of  ambassadors I’ve upset, but, well, he started it. The speech by US Ambassador  Daniel Shapiro at the Institute of National Security Studies in Tel Aviv last  week came the day of the burial of Dafna Meir, a mother of six, who was murdered  by a terrorist in her home in Otniel; the day pregnant Michal Froman was stabbed  by a teenage Palestinian attacker in the community of Tekoa.“Too much  vigilantism goes unchecked, and at times there seem to be two standards of  adherence to the rule of law – one for Israelis and another for Palestinians,”  said Shapiro, or perhaps his boss US Secretary of State John Kerry; his master’s  voice.Israel is the only democratic country to face this constant level  of terrorism; it is not the only country to shoot those who carry out the  attacks. Think San Bernardino or Paris.This week Shapiro took to the  airwaves to clarify his comments with interviews on both Israel Radio and Army  Radio, where he said, in answer to a question: “I understand the timing was not  the best.”Unfortunately, the radio interviews did not clear the air.  It’s hard to retract something said, or rather read, in public. This was a  prepared speech, not a comment taken out of context or a slip of the tongue. The  rules of public-relations damage control require a retraction, apology, and  promise that it won’t happen again. But it will.It already has. This  time it was UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon who gave voice to the double  standards.On January 26, the day Shlomit Krigman was buried in  Jerusalem, the latest victim of Palestinian terrorism, Ban told yet another  meeting on Israel and the Palestinians: “It is human nature to react to  occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and  extremism.”Yes, he first went through the motions of condemning  Palestinian violence, but what’s the point if his comments can be interpreted as  justifying it? There are territorial disputes in places ranging from Crimea to  the Pacific islands; the Sahara to Transdniestria (“an unrecognized breakaway  state that lies along Moldova’s border with Ukraine,” according to National  Geographic).A Facebook friend in Pakistan this week shared the warning  of possible Islamist suicide bombings on educational institutions in the Punjab  region.The UN has clearly failed in its principal aim to “save  succeeding generations from the scourge of war.” It was so focused on Israel and  the Palestinians that either it missed what was going on elsewhere or it didn’t  care.The European Union is not immune: On the contrary, it is based in  Brussels, torn between Flemish and French speakers.Even the polite and  peaceful Canadians, the type of neighbors Israelis not so secretly wish they  had, are involved in a number of disputes, based on linguistic, ethnic and  territorial lines.As Israel’s Ambassador Danny Danon told the UN  Security Council after Ban’s comments, “During the past four months, Israelis  have been stabbed in their homes, shot at in the streets and run over by  terrorists using cars as weapons.“During this period of time, the  council has adopted 12 resolutions against terrorism, and condemned terrorist  attacks in France, Sinai, Lebanon, Mali, Tunisia, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria,  Burkina Faso, Somalia and Sudan.Not once were the lives of Israelis  murdered by terrorists recognized by this council. No condemnation, no  expression of solidarity – not even a statement of concern.”The  perpetrators of all these attacks had something in common, and it wasn’t a life  under “Israeli occupation.”
You don’t have to praise us as we bury our  dead, but don’t throw dirt in our faces and pretend you were aiming for the  graves to pay your last respects.

<title>My word: Failed rhetoric</title>
<date>19/5/2016</date>
<content>
One of the perks of my job is that I get to read – a lot – during  office hours, without feeling guilty. It’s not an unmitigated pleasure, however.  Along with opinion pieces that I enjoy for both their style and sentiment, there  are plenty with which I don’t agree. In some cases, I’ll just appreciate the  writing and move on. Others have no saving graces.Such was the case of  an article by David M. Gordis published in Tikkun magazine under the  heading “Major American Jewish Leader Changes his Mind About Israel.”




The  piece itself was titled “Reflections on Israel 2016.” I felt like I was looking  in a cracked mirror.David Gordis (not to be confused with his nephew  Daniel Gordis) ended his reflections by saying, “Sadly, after a life and career  devoted to Jewish community and Israel, I conclude that in every important way:  Israel has failed to realize its promise for me. A noble experiment, but a  failure.”It wasn’t the word “failure” that riled – it was so  demonstrably incorrect. It was the “experiment,” noble or otherwise.In  my own reflections, influenced by just having celebrated Israel’s 68th birthday,  I concluded that this indicates the real problem – the problem for Israel’s  detractors, that is. Israel is not going away. It’s not an  experiment. It is a homeland.It is no more a failed state, as has  been pointed out, than the US is a failure for not being able to successfully  spread its idea of democracy.The State of Israel was born in 1948,  roughly the same time as, among others, India, Sri Lanka (Ceylon), Myanmar  (Burma), Pakistan and, of course, Jordan. How many other sovereign countries  nearly 70 years old are told they should give up because they’re not what some  people thought they should be? In his introduction to the article, Tikkun editor  Rabbi Michael Lerner wrote: “...We publish it with the same sadness that Gordis  expresses at the end of this article, because many of us at Tikkun magazine  shared the same hopes he expresses below for an Israel that would make Jews  proud by becoming an embodiment of what is best in Jewish tradition, history and  ethics, rather than a manifestation of all the psychological and spiritual  damage that has been done to our people, which now acts as an oppressor to the  Palestinian people. For those of us who continue to love Judaism and the wisdom  of our Jewish culture and traditions, pointing out Israel’s current distortions  gives us no pleasure, but only saddens us deeply.”It saddens me too –  not only because it is based on a false narrative, but because it also provides  fodder for the campaigns of Israel’s many enemies, thus feeding the violence,  not ending it.The knife attacks, car rammings, roadside ambushes, and  the mortar shells and rockets launched from Gaza are not the attempts by  Palestinians to break out from unbearable oppression, they are the cause of the  checkpoints, restrictions and security fence, better known in some circles as  “The Apartheid Wall.”The apartheid imagery is another  falsehood.The obvious concept behind it is to brand the Zionists –  Israeli Jews – as colonialists with no place in the Middle  East. Delegitimize them, boycott them, threaten them enough and they will  either leave or hand over the reins to the Palestinians according to the White  versus Black South African model.Such thinking is both a mistake and  more fuel for violence.While there is a flow of “refugees” from the  region seeking sanctuary in Europe, Israel still serves its original purpose as  a Jewish homeland, taking in thousands of Jews being pushed by growing  anti-Semitism in all its ugly forms and attracted by the life in what is far  from a failed state.Israel is not a foreign body in this land and, as I  have often noted, it is was no more founded because of European guilt over the  Holocaust than any other country formed as the British Empire crumbled  post-World War II.Incidentally, when the government was formed a year  ago I was asked repeatedly about the country’s reported swing to the Right. I  noted that the one far-right party had failed to pass the electoral threshold  and there are now more Arab MKs than in any previous Knesset.Mosques and  migrant centers are frequently torched in Sweden. Masked anti-immigrant thugs  parade through streets in places like Finland, Norway and Germany. Greece  has its very tarnished Golden Dawn.Does anyone suggest these countries  should just call it a day? Last year I read a short news item on an immigrant  woman burned to death in an apparent hate-related arson attack in  Paris.Search as I may, I have not been able to find her name. If you  can’t blame the Jews, it ain’t news.This in no way is a defense of hate  crimes anywhere, in any form. They’re despicable, regardless of who is the  perpetrator and who is the victim.I WON’T dwell on David Gordis’s  writing style (but if I ever use a phrase like “probing Jewish interiorities,”  feel free to poke me back). It’s the substance, or substance abuse, that bothers  me. Even Gordis, while complaining “the bottom line for me is that it has gone  terribly wrong,” has to admit: “On the positive side, Israel’s accomplishments  have been remarkable. Israel has created a thriving economy, and has been a  refuge for hundreds of thousands of the displaced and the needy. Israel has  generated a rich and diverse cultural life and its scientific and educational  achievements have been exemplary.”Not an abject failure, then. His  definition of failure is different.“Present-day Israel has discarded the  rational, the universal and the visionary. These values have been subordinated  to a cruel and oppressive occupation, an emphatic materialism, severe  inequalities rivaling the worst in the Western world and distorted by a fanatic,  obscurantist and fundamentalist religion which encourages the worst behaviors  rather than the best.“And most depressing of all for me, is that I see  no way out, no way forward which will reverse the current reality. Rightwing  control in Israel is stronger and more entrenched than ever. The establishment  leadership in the American Jewish community is silent in the face of this dismal  situation, and there are no recognizable trends that can move Israel out of this  quagmire.”Daniel Gordis (who received a flurry of concerned emails from  those who confused his name with his uncle’s) later wrote in Mosaic magazine  something that I also thought when I read the Tikkun piece: “In an article that  makes not a single mention of the Jewish people – or of its enemies – the word  ‘I’ appears 14 times, and ‘me’ a few more. Setting aside the narcissism of this  exercise, may one point out that Israel was not dreamed of or founded in order  to realize its supposed ‘promise for’ any one of us, let alone to soothe the  moral disquiet of Jews living in American suburbia? It was created to transform  the existential condition of the Jewish people – and, despite its many failings  (like the failings of America and other decent countries), it has done just  that, and brilliantly. It takes a willful blindness to Jewish history and an  astounding commitment to the supreme value of self-gratification to conclude  anything different.”The “failed experiment” rhetoric is a worn-out  refrain.For example, in March 2003 (a month in which more than 20  Israelis were killed in Palestinian terrorist attacks), Kirkpatrick Sale wrote a  piece in CounterPunch titled “Time to End the Israel Experiment.” The opening  paragraph was: “Now that Ariel Sharon has been returned to power and his regime  endorsed in its brutal occupation of Palestine, it seems to me that the time has  come to ask whether the 50-year-old experiment known as the state of Israel has  proven to be a failure and should be abandoned.”That would be the Ariel  Sharon who two years later uprooted every last Jew from Gaza in what could be  considered a failed experiment – the hope that by transferring the Jews out of  the area, the Palestinians would stop rocket attacks and build up their own  successful state instead of trying to destroy ours.Even more ironically,  Israel’s response to the three mini wars launched by Hamas-controlled Gaza has  only increased the anti-Israel vitriol.A decade ago, during the Second  Lebanon War, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen began an op-ed with the  line, “The greatest mistake Israel could make at the moment is to forget that  Israel itself is a mistake.”The response led him to write the book  Israel: Is It Good For The Jews? I’ll answer that: While not perfect – what  country is? – Israel is not only good for the Jews, it is good for the  world.The biggest mistake is to use double standards to judge  it.

<title>My word: Normalization: The real road to peace</title>
<date>27/10/2016</date>
<content>
While friends and acquaintances were in  throwback-to-the-Sixties mode last week, I rained on their parades: The hit  parade and a peace march, that is.The first friends to be shocked were  Bob Dylan fans when I confessed that ever since I’d heard of the elusive  songwriter’s Nobel Prize for Literature a playlist of Leonard Cohen’s greatest  hits had been going through my mind. I wonder if even the Nobel committee by now  isn’t thinking they should have granted Cohen the prize instead.




In any  case, without detracting from Dylan’s repertoire, his songs are precisely  that: songs. Try reading as poetry “And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a  hard, it’s a hard / And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall” rather than hearing it  as lyrics and you’ll understand the problem.It’s not the poems of  medieval Spanish Jew Yehuda Halevi, whose works are still being set to music in  Israel, or King David’s psalms, whose ancient Hebrew words also are constantly  given modern Israeli melodies.I realize it would be hard to grant King  David such a prestigious award – not because he’s dead, but because there would  be some member of UNESCO who would immediately file a motion that David’s name  was Daoud and his psalms, written in Hebrew, were actually Islamic  literature.The second group of friends and acquaintances whose  enthusiasm I dampened were among the thou- sands of participants in the “March  of Hope,” from Rosh Hanikra on the Lebanese border to the Prime Minister’s  Residence in Jerusalem. Organized by the NGO Women Wage Peace, they gathered  outside the PM’s official home where they sang songs and gave off good vibes in  a sort of Kumbaya experience, barely marred by the fact that the prime minister  put up a black curtain to literally cut himself off from them.The  following morning, I met a friend who was still on a high from it.I  tried to gently explain my reservations. I don’t believe women are more likely  to make peace than men – especially considering that wars broke out on the watch  of prime ministers Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir. I also don’t  believe that women suffer more from the death of a child or loved one in war or  by terrorism, although they might express it differently. Liberian activist and  Nobel Peace Prize winner Leymah Roberta Gbowee, an impressive figure with a  powerful message against violence, was among the noteworthy people in Jerusalem  who joined the battle cry for peace. And as I told my friend, I’m far happier  seeing thou- sands rallying for peace rather than demanding war or celebrating a  “Day of Rage” – but it seems limited in its real impact.Sometimes it  seems people are more interested in recreating the narrative and vibe of the  Sixties than recognizing and addressing today’s very real problems. It’s one of  the reasons the word “apartheid” is thrown so ridiculously at Israel.Far  more significant than the peace march was the succa set up by Efrat Council head  Oded Revivi. He invited local Palestinians to join him in the traditional  temporary booth during the Tabernacles holiday, part of an ongoing effort to  build bridges between the Palestinian villages and the Gush Etzion community.No sooner had I praised it, however, than four of the Palestinian  participants were arrested by Palestinian Authority police, leading Revivi to  post on Facebook a demand for the release of those “being interrogated for the  crime of drinking coffee with Jews.”Following intense pressure, the four  were released, but the not-so-subtle threat against normalization  remained.It reminded me how in July, a Palestinian man was interviewed  in the Israeli media about how he stopped to help the family after the terrorist  drive-by shooting in which Rabbi Miki Mark was killed. No Nobel Peace Prize for  him. He was fired by the PA for helping Jews. The PA evidently demands permanent  conflict to go along with the Palestinians’ “permanent refugee status” at the  UN.This is the lie behind the BDS movement. Boycott, divestment and  sanctions of Israel, singling the country out for a delegitimization campaign,  is not about improving the lives and situation of Palestinians: It’s about  negating the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign state.When Israel  objected to the latest joint Palestinian-Jordanian UNESCO resolutions  purposely ignoring Jewish links to the Temple Mount and Western Wall and  keeping the Old City on the list of “endangered sites,” the Palestinian  representative absurdly accused Israel of “politicizing” the issue. But the  regular attempts to rewrite history (negating Christian biblical roots as well  as Jewish ones) do nothing to bring about peace and justice: They are turning  it into a religious war – jihad. And where was the outrage when Palestinian  rockets were launched from Gaza on Jerusalem in 2012 and 2014? Who would have  been blamed had one landed on the Temple Mount (or Haram al-Sharif as it’s known  to those firing the rockets)? In an interview this week with the widely read  Arabic-language newspaper Al-Quds , published in Jerusalem, Defense Minister  Avigdor Liberman presented his plan for a two-state solution involving swaps of  populated lands.His ideas aren’t new. He has touted them regularly for  a dozen years. Sadly, the response wasn’t new either and it had nothing to do  with substance.Among the most vitriolic was the statement issued by the  Palestinian Syndicate of Journalists: “The syndicate considers the interview in  itself a deplorable form of normalization with the occupation, what’s more a  cooperation with it,” the statement says. “...The union renews its categorical  rejection of all forms of normalization with the occupation, including the media  normalization.”There’s more but it doesn’t get any better.I  wasn’t surprised. At the European Federation of Journalists Conference in  Sarajevo in April, Shaike Komornik, on behalf of the Israel Federation of  Journalists, and I, representing the Jerusalem Association of Journalists,  persuaded the representatives of the Palestinian Syndicate of Journalists to  agree to the JAJ’s long-standing proposal to establish a hotline between our  respective associations to help journalists who encounter problems in the course  of their work.We sat and chatted over coffee in the hotel bar together  with the chief Palestinian representative, Nasser Abu Baker, and a local  Palestinian journalist, but there is no photo to record the moment. Abu Baker  adamantly declined to have his picture taken together with Israelis.If  it is dangerous for them to be seen in public sharing a coffee and conversation  with Israelis, they have them- selves and their own rhetoric to blame.As  soon as the news of the hotline was published in Arabic, the Palestinians backed  off, decrying any move that could be interpreted as normalization.The  Palestinian journalists should be among the first calling for a free press. They  also should have been among those questioning the arrests of other Palestinians for sitting down to chat with Israelis.It doesn’t matter how many  roads we walk down, to paraphrase Dylan, we won’t be on the road to peace until  both sides are willing to recognize each other and focus on what we have in  common. Normalization should be, well, normal, not a crime against  humanity.

<title>My Word: Political correctness and craziness</title>
<date>11/8/2016</date>
<content>
Close to my apartment block is a hostel for adults suffering from mental health  issues. The residents are encouraged to be as much a part of the local community  as possible. One man can usually be seen conducting an argument with himself;  another seems to be involved in an animated conversation with someone nobody  else can see.I don’t fear them. I suspect that all of us occasionally  argue with ourselves or with a foe who is not present to argue back. The  difference is most of us don’t do it in public.




My neighbors obviously  have to cope with a lot of problems – real and imaginary – that I can only guess  at.Lately, I’ve started to think that those in similar situations abroad  are facing a new danger, one they might not yet be fully aware of, and were they  to say something they would probably have “paranoia” added to the list of their  symptoms.The mentally ill are facing an extraordinary new image problem  through no fault of their own.In the general eagerness of the  politically correct to avoid blaming attacks on terrorists fueled by radical  Islam, there seems to be a global trend to try to find a way to pin the motive  on psychiatric problems.Placing the blame on the perpetrator’s  psychiatric issues is doubly dangerous: It ignores the possibility of Islamist  brainwashing before an attack and, in an effort to avoid charges of Islamophobia  at any cost, it maligns another sector, even weaker: those who suffer from  mental health problems but who threaten no one (other than themselves in certain  tragic cases).This became particularly apparent last week when a young  man, originally described in news headlines as “Norwegian,” stabbed an American  woman to death and wounded five other people, including a young Israeli woman  who, mistaking him for a victim, had tried to help him.The Somali-born  Norwegian was also said to be suffering from a psychiatric condition.The  likelihood that this was exposure to Islamist brainwashing in one form or  another was avoided.Similarly, stabbing incidents, ax attacks, shootings  and a bombing in Germany, France and elsewhere were immediately ascribed to  psychiatric backgrounds.But how can you tackle a problem if you can’t  say it out loud? Isn’t the first step to recovery always acknowledging the  problem? Is not labeling the mentally ill as serious an injustice as labeling  any other sector in the community? Recently I received an email from someone  with an Arabic-sounding name and a German address telling me that I “... assume  proudly the title of ‘Islamophobe in Chief’ while at the same time accusing  everyone of anti-Semitism.”To which I can only say: (a) You don’t know  me, and (b) You don’t know the meaning of the word Islamophobe.Perhaps I  am an “Islamist-phobe.” I am very concerned about the growth of radical Islam.  It’s a concern shared by many Muslims.Some stand up bravely to it;  others are paralyzed by their fears.Among the saddest stories I came  across this week was the dismissal of a Palestinian doctor who stopped to help  the family of Rabbi Michael Mark after he was shot dead in a roadside terrorist  ambush a few weeks ago, leaving his wife and children trapped in the car. In my  July 8 column, titled “Summer tears, fears, and rays of light,” the Palestinians  who aided the wounded and traumatized family were the “ray of light” – “a  reminder that there are good people out there.” I was particularly impressed  that the two Palestinian men were willing to talk openly about the need to try  to save lives, all lives. Palestinian leaders are happy to be treated in Israeli  hospitals, but decry anything that could be considered normalization.Now  “settlers,” including Mount Hebron Regional Council head Yochai Damri, are  calling on the government to provide a permit to enable the Palestinian doctor  to work in Israel instead of the job he lost.Another disheartening story  came from Rio, where the Olympic delegation from Lebanon proved to be bad sports  – refusing to travel on the same bus as the Israelis. The Syrians and Iranians  are also going to great lengths to avoid competing against  Israelis.Forty-four years after 11 Israeli sportsmen were killed by  Palestinian terrorists at the Olympics in Munich, the world has a long way to go  before it can say it has learned the lesson – or even internalized the  ostensible message of the Games. (Although this year, for the first time, there  is a separate team of refugee competitors.) THE LETHAL stabbing attack by “the  Norwegian madman” quickly became old news.By August 5, one of the  biggest stories coming out of London was the group of protesters from the UK  branch of Black Lives Matter who blocked the road to Heathrow Airport at the  height of the summer holiday season to mark five years since the fatal shooting  of Mark Duggan by British police.The movement is growing, and it’s  growing more radical.Last week, Black Lives Matter adopted a platform  singling out Israel (what a surprise) for special denunciation, calling for  boycott, sanctions and divestment actions and linking the black cause with the  Palestinian one.It was a move decried by several left-wing Jewish groups  who felt BLM had gone too far: “The platform’s assertion that Israel is  committing genocide against the Palestinian people is outrageously incorrect,  and deeply offensive to those who have lived through an actual genocidal attempt  to exterminate an entire people or who are descended from and related to victims  and survivors of genocide – as many J Street members are,” wrote J Street  founder Jeremy Ben-Ami in a blog.“The characterization of Israel as an  ‘apartheid state’ is also misleading and unhelpful.The best way to  resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the occupation is to address the  unique and specific circumstances and conditions underlying them, without  insistence on fitting them within the ill-fitting framework of a different  conflict from a different time and place.”I’d be interested in knowing  who is financing BLM’s “fact-finding” trips to “Israel-Palestine,” and why this  is considered so central to its cause.Efrat resident Ardie Geldman, who  recently met a group of Quaker high schoolers on such a trip (they probably  wanted to see how “a settler” lives), discovered the latest mutation of the  Black Lives Matter mantra. When he suggested that “All lives matter,” he was  firmly told that that is a “racial slur,” denying the special situation of the  blacks.I’m not sure where this is going, but I fear that some activists  are blindly following a moral compass that has accidentally set them in the  opposite direction to what they intended.Recently, I came across a quote  sometimes credited to judicial philosopher Zechariah Chafee, “Your right to  swing your arms ends just where the other man’s nose begins.”It seems as  good a rule as any for these perplexing, politically correct times.And  you should be very careful about whom you are calling  crazy.

<title>My Word: The real and surreal Jerusalem</title>
<date>2/6/2016</date>
<content>
There is often something surreal about life in Jerusalem – an extraordinary  quality that comes from living in a place where the holy and the mundane survive  not so much sideby- side as simultaneously on two different levels: the heavenly  and the very down-to-earth.Recently, I received a reminder of the city’s  other- worldly character. During a brief trip to Sarajevo in April, I met a  woman who couldn’t believe her luck in having a chance to chat to a real live  Jerusalemite.




Only two weeks before, she gushingly told me, had she  discovered that the Jerusalem of the Bible and the Jerusalem in the news are one  and the same.A Jewish friend had explained it to her and she still  couldn’t get over it.The newly enlightened woman was well-educated,  spoke several languages, and was involved in the tourism industry. Like most  Sarajevans I met, she was proud of her city’s nickname “Jerusalem of the  Balkans,” for the number of churches, mosques and synagogues existing in close  proximity. She now thirsted to know about the real Jerusalem, “my  Jerusalem.”She walked with me for some 15 minutes through sleet and  snow, happy to have a chance to catch up on some three millennia of history and  telling me of her newfound plans to visit and see for herself the biblical  places she’s heard about.It’s the same city, but any place will change  with time, let alone 3,000 years, I reflected. The wonderful thing about  Jerusalem is what you can still see, feel and experience.When we parted,  she gave me a strong hug, as if through me she could reach out and embrace the  Holy City.As I dried off my wet clothes and tried to warm up – feeling a  very long way from my home under Mediterranean skies – I wondered how it was  that an intelligent person in the Western world had not made the connection  between the two Jerusalems, the ancient and the new, for so long. It’s not like  the city lacks publicity.One of the reasons, I believe, is a matter of  names. If they only ever hear of al-Aksa and not of the Temple Mount, eventually  the compound with the mosques will replace the site of the ancient temples in  people’s consciousness.My journey to Sarajevo took place just a few days  after UNESCO’s executive board adopted a resolution whose language utterly  ignored Jewish (and Christian) ties to the area. It referred to the Temple Mount  exclusively as al-Aksa Mosque/al-Haram al Sharif and called the Western Wall  plaza by its Arabic name “al-Buraq.”The constant renaming is almost  Orwellian, and it apparently works. Thousands of years of Jewish history and  yearning are being purposely erased.That’s why we repeat Psalm 137’s “If  I forget thee, O Jerusalem....” at every Jewish wedding, passing the history and  its message on.O JERUSALEM. I have neighbors who remember the 1948 siege  of the War of Independence and for years kept an empty bucket on the roof to  catch rainfall that was too good to waste; friends recall the dangers of the  pre-1967 years, when they were taught how to dodge Jordanian snipers. Most of my  friends commemorate the fall of the First and Second Temples as naturally as  they celebrate the city’s reunification, the anniversary of which falls this  year on June 5.This is Jerusalem.Most of us just spend our lives  worrying about the same things that concern people everywhere: the transport  system, vagaries of the weather and cost of living. But the holy is never very  far – be it reflected in the street names, the sound of Hebrew being spoken; the  unique change of pace as the Sabbath is welcomed.Jews and Arabs share  the same stores, cafes and public transport – despite the efforts of our  detractors to portray Israel as an apartheid state. We also share the same  annoyances with City Hall bureaucracy, poorly maintained streets and  unpredictable water bills.I realize that Jerusalem’s Arab residents do  not see the reunification of the city in the same miraculous terms as I do, but  I don’t feel the need to apologize.As I’ve said before, I’m proud to be  on the side that didn’t launch wars in 1948, 1967 and 1973 – and  lose.I’m happy to be part of a people who build and rebuild Jerusalem,  making it grow and flourish. I don’t occupy Jerusalem; I live in it.In  Jerusalem, like Sarajevo for that matter, the more people of all religions  understand that their welfare and livelihoods depend on peace, commerce and  creating an attractive environment for tourists (and pilgrims), the safer we  will all be.DURING A visit to Taiwan last month – I usually stick much  closer to home, it just so happened that I had two trips abroad one after the  other – I had a different insight. Having traveled from the capital, Taipei, to  the most significant city in the south, Kaohsiung, I reflected with the  Taiwanese Foreign Ministry liaison officer on the “two-city  phenomenon.”Many countries have two metropolises engaged in a friendly  rivalry, we noted: Madrid and Barcelona; Toronto and Montreal; Melbourne and  Sydney; Rome and Milan; Brussels and Antwerp; Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. You  can add your favorites and their rival counterparts to the list.In  Israel, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv struggle with each other. Although firmly on  Jerusalem’s side, I have come to see them as a form of yin and yang, two  complementary forms that together make a whole; pray and play.In Tel  Aviv, the Azrieli buildings – those circular, square and triangular towers – are  an iconic landmark.The observatory at the top of the circular building  offers a bird’s-eye view of the city and the Mediterranean.For the best  view of Jerusalem’s history – and the city itself – climb to the top of the  Tower of David Museum. Both the sea off Tel Aviv’s beaches and the biblically  renowned hills surrounding Jerusalem have a timeless quality that puts you in  your place.Jerusalem Day will give way to Shavuot the following week –  one of the three festivals when Jews in Temple times made a pilgrimage to the  city.The are holidays and festivals; fun and prayers; everyday life and  the extraordinary. There is singing from synagogues, chiming church bells and  the muezzins’ calls to prayers. There’s traffic and the noise of construction as  a city rooted in time immemorial constantly tries to meet current and future  needs.
Jerusalem is both real and spiritual. No wonder strangers have a  hard time understanding its special essence and the secret of its  survival.

<title>No Holds Barred: Another Hollywood Israel hater</title>
<date>5/4/2016</date>
<content>
Wallace Shawn is an actor and playwright best known for his character Vizzini in the movie The Princess Bride. Anyone who has seen the film will remember his famous catchphrase (“Inconceivable!”), that he says whenever something goes wrong. Shawn is also well known for voicing the dinosaur Rex in the Toy Story films, and he has acted and voiced characters in a number of television shows and films. Blue Dream studios and director Tony Bancroft are currently in production for the film Animal Crackers where Shawn is a member of the cast.Unfortunately, most people are unaware of Shawn’s activism directed toward harming the State of Israel. He is on the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace, a rabidly anti-Israel group that tries to hide its agenda by labeling itself as a pro-Israel group that simply wants a peaceful resolution with the Palestinians. Shawn’s active participation with this organization as well as his past statements about the Jewish state are truly unsettling.




Jewish Voice for Peace’s ultimate goal is the destruction of the State of Israel. While the group claims to only work actively toward boycotting the West Bank, Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, has said, “We do feel connected to the global BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] movement. We consider ourselves a part of it. We would defend the right of people to do a full boycott. This is what Palestinians are asking for, and we respect their call.” The JVP website also states: “We believe that the time-honored, non-violent tools proposed by the BDS call provide powerful opportunities to make that vision real.”However, contrary to their assertions of non-violence, NGO Monitor wrote an investigative report on JVP showing the group “supports or has partnered with groups such as Sabeel, Electronic Intifada, Al-Awda, International ANSWER Coalition, the International Solidarity Movement, and Students for Justice in Palestine, all of which label Israel a racist apartheid state, support BDS and, in some cases, support violence against Israelis.”JVP also refuses to endorse a two-state solution and many members are against the very idea of a Jewish state. Furthermore their website states their ultimate goal is for Israel to, in part, “promote the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties.”Anyone who knows anything about this conflict knows that calling for the right of millions of Palestinians, including members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, to enter Israel’s borders and seize properties and residences that they claim their grandparents once owned is in essence a call for the destruction of Israel.Judith Butler, who is on the academic advisory council of JVP, in response to a question about the relationship between Hamas and Hezbollah and the “Left,” answered, “I think, yes, understanding Hamas/Hezbollah as social movements that are progressive that are on the left; that are part of a global left is extremely important.” With disturbing opinions such as this it is no wonder she is so strongly affiliated with JVP.The Anti-Defamation League in 2010 identified JVP as one of the top 10 anti-Israel groups in the country. ADL explained, “While JVP’s activists try to portray themselves as Jewish critics of Israel, their ideology is nothing but a complete rejection of Israel. In May 2008, for example, members of JVP protested many of the celebrations of Israel’s 60th anniversary that took place around the country, essentially illustrating that they oppose Israel’s very existence.”Wallace Shawn’s involvement with this movement reveals his real “humanitarian” side. He has given absurd interviews and penned columns against the Jewish state. His complete ignorance of what Israelis have been facing is glaringly obvious from his own words. He’s stated that Israel is such a racist country that Palestinians understandably see the Jews as “an enemy that can’t be reasoned with but can only be feared, hated and, if possible, killed.” He also writes that since Israel is such an immoral country “the future of the Jews looks increasingly dim.”Shawn says that the Jewish people are now viewed as the victimizers and said that, “From a moral point of view it was better when we [the Jews] were victims.” Yes, in his warped sense of morality, rather than Jews trying to defend themselves against genocidal enemies like Hamas, Shawn feels the Jews were better off as they were led into Auschwitz’s gas chambers.In 2014 the Anti-Defamation League released a pro-Israel poster signed by a number of celebrities and Hollywood executives that featured the words of Golda Meir: “We can forgive [them] for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with [them] when they love their children more than they hate us.” The ad also states that, “These haunting words of Golda Meir are as current as today’s headlines. She could have been talking about Hamas.”Shawn was so incensed by this ad that he took it upon himself to pen a “translation” of what he thought the poster was really saying. Shawn believes that what Golda Meir was really trying to say is, “When we kill the children of Arabs, the Arabs made us do it. They hate us so much, they are so angry, that they do things that enrage us and make us kill children. If they were decent people who loved their children, they would set aside their hatred and stop provoking us, and we would then stop killing the children.”Shawn goes on to libel the former prime minister, writing, “Golda Meir can be interpreted as saying here that she plans to kill the children of Arabs up until the moment when, in her sole judgment, the Arabs stop feeling ‘hate’ and become sufficiently unprovoking and pacified.”Hamas itself has said it loves death more than the Israelis love life. Videos have shown Palestinian mothers happily blessing their bomb-strapped children prior to their suicide missions. Hamas and members of the PA both regularly incite the population with calls for terrorist attacks and the genocide of all Jews on earth (including Shawn). The moment they stop hating the Jews to that extent, then the fighting can maybe have a chance of ending. That Shawn would defend or legitimize Palestinian terrorism and the corrupt, murderous governments of Hamas and the PA is sickening.It would be easy to just laugh at people like Wallace Shawn if it weren’t for the fact that their very involved activism incites hatred against the State of Israel and the Jewish people, and his actions and words give justification for the murder of Jews.

<title>No Holds Barred: Hillary’s Clinton’s troubling relationship with Israel-hating adviser</title>
<date>11/1/2016</date>
<content>
Who is Max Blumenthal, why is he a Hillary Clinton Israel  Svengali and does he pose as big a headache for Hillary as Jeremiah Wright did  for President Barack Obama? The well-known proverb declares you can tell a lot  about a person by the company they keep.Last summer, in the wake of the  impending Iran deal, which she herself helped to create and vocally supported,  Hillary reached out to calm the jitters of her wealthiest Democratic Jewish  supporters in an attempt to convince them that she would always support Israel.  She also emphasized that she utterly condemns the Boycott, Divestment, and  Sanctions movement that Israel is currently facing.




But she has been a  harsh critic of the Jewish state, often relishing her role.During a  speech in 2012 she spoke of Israel’s “lack of generosity” and “lack of empathy”  toward the Palestinians. She admitted that during her time as secretary of state  she oftentimes was the “designated yeller” at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  She once yelled at him for 45 minutes when Israel granted permits to build  houses in the eastern neighborhoods of its capital Jerusalem during Vice  President Joe Biden’s visit to Israel.But with the recent dumps of  emails from Hillary’s private Internet server the public has received an  in-depth look at the very important role that Sidney Blumenthal played for  Hillary during her time in the Obama administration.Blumenthal is one of  Hillary’s closest advisers and a longtime family friend. He was a senior adviser  during Bill Clinton’s presidency and served again as senior adviser for  Hillary’s failed 2008 run for the White House.Blumenthal was clearly a  man whose advice Hillary trusted and she was willing to pay him $10,000 a month  for his services. However the information coming to light paints a troubled  picture.What they show is a slew of anti-Israel writings and opinions,  many of which originated from articles written by Blumenthal’s own son, Max  Blumenthal.Max is a writer and self-declared “anti-Zionist,” known for  his active support of the BDS movement and his calls for the dismantling of the  State of Israel. He trolls pro-Israel writers, as I can personally attest. Max’s  widely panned 2013 book Goliath, Life and Loathing in Greater Israel is full of  anti-Israel rants, omissions and outright lies. In it, he repeatedly compares  the Jewish state to Nazi Germany, and advocates that the majority of Jews  currently living in Israel must be removed from the land to make way for a  Palestinian state. Mimicking the Islamic State’s acronym ISIL, Max created the  hashtag 
JSIL – Jewish State in the Levant. To Max, the democratic State of  Israel and Islamic State are morally equivalent entities.His opinions  are seen as radical leftist claptrap even by Left-leaning detractors of the  Jewish state. The Nation columnist Eric Alterman – himself a critic of Israel’s  presence in the West bank – described how the book “could have been published by  the Hamas Book-of-the-Month Club.” J. J. Goldberg of The Forward described  Goliath as an “unpleasant book.” By contrast, David Duke, the racist former Klu  Klux Klan leader, praised Blumenthal’s book.What is truly concerning is  that Sidney Blumenthal has not only failed to ever condemn his son’s anti-Israel  writings, but has actively advocated for and defended the warped, outrageous  ideas conveyed therein. In fact, after learning of Alterman’s critique of Max’s  book, Blumenthal began sending out emails attacking Alterman and supporting his  son’s shoddy and repugnant anti-Israel scholarship. One such email included an  article from the radical anti-Zionist website Mondoweiss (which loved the book  and for which Max has written for in the past) attacking Alterman’s  review.But even more concerning than all of this is that Hillary  Clinton, the nation’s chief diplomat, valued Max Blumenthal’s disturbed  anti-Israel rants so much that she forked out $120,000 a year to his dad to keep  the flow of information coming.Among the emails Sidney Blumenthal sent  to Hillary is a link to a November 2010 blog post written by his son. In it, Max  attempts to equate the views and policies of far Right Dutch politician Geert  Wilders with those of Israel. Max goes so far as to claim that Wilders learned  from, and formulated his views as a result of his living in Israel. Max writes:  “Israel’s mainstream leadership echoes Wilders’ crudest talking points on a  regular basis.” Max describes how “the extreme right [in Europe] is also  attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest ideals. While  some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see  Israel as a racist apartheid state – and they like it.”He continues,  “They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells  the world to go to hell; they admire Israel’s settler culture.”Max also  writes, “Most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges  its ethnic majority above all others to the point that it systematically  humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass.” He adds, “The endgame  of the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.”What  was Hillary’s response to this racist, anti-Israel tirade? She writes back to  Blumenthal, “A very smart piece – as usual.”Before her speech to AIPAC  in March of 2010, Blumenthal sent Hillary a column written by Uri Avnery  claiming Israel was pursuing goals contrary to the United States’ interests  while “starting a rebellion” against the US.Hillary’s response to  Blumenthal was, “I have to speak to AIPAC tomorrow.How – and should I –  use this?” Blumenthal responds that with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian peace  process, Hillary should, “Hold Bibi’s [Netanyahu’s] feet to the  fire.”Blumenthal also recommended to Hillary to try and mention in a  positive light the George Soros-funded organization J Street, which is fiercely  critical of the Jewish state.Blumenthal tells Hillary to “remind [AIPAC]  in as subtle but also direct a way as you can that it does not have a monopoly  over American Jewish opinion. Bibi is stage managing US Jewish organizations  (and neocons, and the religious right, and whomever else he can muster) against  the administration.AIPAC itself has become an organ of the Israeli  right, specifically Likud.”Holding Netanyahu’s feet to the fire,  advocating for J Street and courting AIPAC’s favor while simultaneously viewing  it as a conspiracy organization being wielded against the interests of the  United States? These are the musings of Hillary Clinton as she considers  American policy toward Israel.Blumenthal also offered some truly bizarre  analysis in an email to Hillary in the aftermath of the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid.  During that operation Israeli soldiers boarded a Turkish vessel approaching the  Gaza Strip, where they were brutally attacked, stabbed and thrown off ledges by  the ship’s passengers, resulting in a shootout and casualties, as video evidence  of the event makes clear. However, back in May of that year, before any of the  facts had been properly clarified, Blumenthal provided Hillary with an armchair  psychoanalysis of the events in which he states, “Bibi desperately seeks his  father’s approbation and can never equal his dead brother.” Blumenthal explains  that this must be what led Netanyahu to order the operation, adding, “The raid  on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe [in which Netanyahu’s brother  was killed] except that there are no hostages, no guns (on the Turkish ship),  it’s not in Africa, and it’s a fiasco; otherwise, it’s  Entebbe.”Throughout all of this, there is no email showing Hillary  objecting to any of these anti-Israel articles and opinions that Blumenthal  continually sent her. To this day, even in light of all these damning exchanges  being made public, Hillary has yet to apologize or publicly distance herself  from Sidney or Max Blumenthal. Will Hillary disassociate herself from the  crackpot anti-Israel theories of Max Blumenthal? We’re all waiting to  see.

<title>No Holds Barred: Should we vote for Hillary simply because she’s a woman?</title>
<date>8/2/2016</date>
<content>
While Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem scandalously scold young women to  vote for Hillary Clinton just because she’s a woman, I have not seen anything  similar in the Jewish community.No one is saying we should “feel the  Bern” just because Senator Bernie Sanders is a member of the tribe.




And  no Jewish leader is condemning those Jews who do not vote for Sanders to hell  the way that Albright is doing to women who will not vote for  Clinton.And it’s to our credit that this is so. You vote for the most  qualified candidate, not the candidate who best matches your ethnicity or  gender. You vote for a candidate that respects and represents your values,  whatever their identity.With Israel facing yet another horrible  terrorism wave, and with its very existence threatened by the catastrophic Iran  deal, the question that has to be asked by the pro-Israel community is which  candidate will be the best defender of Israel.Last week I wrote about  the State Department’s email dump of Clinton’s communications from her private  server. The former secretary of state received a veritable trove of advice and  information about Israel from her closest advisers. Curiously, it’s almost all  negative and hostile to Israel.It behooves the candidate to explain the  emails and why they are nearly all of such a negative nature.This week I  enclose some more gems.Martin Indyk was advising Clinton during her time  as secretary of state. In 2007, Indyk’s Brookings Institution, a purportedly  objective non-partisan government think tank, opened up a branch in Qatar, a  country that is virulently anti-Israel and which currently serves as Hamas’ main  financial backer. Seven years later it was revealed that Indyk’s relationship  with Qatar had progressed to the point that Qatar had given $14.8 million  dollars to Indyk’s institute. This phenomenon of foreign governments purchasing  political influence via think tanks in Washington has been well attested to in  the past.Keep in mind that in the background of this concealed, blatant  conflict of interest, Indyk was one of the top diplomats assigned to formulating  policy and negotiating a two-state solution in Israel. The bombshell revelations  of these Qatar donations compromised Indyk immensely and Netanyahu’s government  responded by saying that Indyk could not be trusted.Nonetheless, during  Clinton’s time as secretary of state, Indyk had her ear when it came to  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Indyk’s emails to Clinton show a  Qatari-inspired anti-Israel bias. He talks about the need to look, not at  Netanyahu’s politics, but his “psychology.” He writes to Clinton of Netanyahu:  “[A]t heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit.” He attacks Netanyahu over  and over as having “inflated demands” and lacking the willingness to risk  Israel’s security with a West Bank that we all know would likely become yet  another Hamastan.He writes nothing of Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas’s continual incitement and calls for murder of Israelis, or the  need to outlaw terrorist groups.Indyk also describes how world opinion  can be used against Netanyahu, writing, “If Israel doesn’t make a serious move,  it will further delegitimize its standing internationally.” He also describes  how the US can use the fear of a potential nuclear Iran to force Israel to sign  a deal with the Palestinians, because “Bibi needs President Obama in his corner  to deal with the threat from Iran.”Then there is Jake Sullivan,  Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, who has also been revealed to harbor  anti-Israel views. In one heavily redacted email to Clinton regarding talks with  Netanyahu, Sullivan’s subject line reads “dealing with Netanyahu.” This is the  cavalier way in which many of Clinton’s subordinates refer to the prime minister  of Israel. His name rarely comes with titles. It’s just “Netanyahu.”But  I digress.Sullivan has been shown to be a big fan of Peter Beinart, the  man whom I recently debated in Tel Aviv and who justified terrorist attacks  against Israelis and demanded that America punish Israel for electing Netanyahu.  Beinart, in our debate, compared the world’s foremost Jewish philanthropist and  the principal sponsor of Birthright, Sheldon Adelson, to the terrorist leaders  of Iran.Beinart’s writings are blatantly anti-Israel and he has become  infamous in the Jewish community for his calls for a complete boycott of Judea  and Samaria in the hopes of forcing Israel to withdraw. The fact that Hamas or  Islamic State would inevitably overthrow Abbas’s weak government, as happened in  Gaza, does not weigh in Beinart’s demands that Israel be punished if it does not  accede to his demands.Unfortunately, it isn’t just Sullivan – Clinton  herself is a fan of Beinart.After Sid Blumenthal sent Clinton an  anti-Israel column by Beinart, Clinton forwarded it to Sullivan, writing, “Pls  read so we can discuss.” In response, Sullivan writes “Fascinating.”When  Blumenthal sent Clinton an article by his son Max filled with his usual  anti-Israel drivel, Clinton forwarded the article to Sullivan with the message,  “Interesting reading.”Sullivan responds, “This is really fascinating.  Does Beinart get into all of this?” Clinton responds, “Yes.”In other  words, Sullivan’s response to another Israel- hating Max Blumenthal article is  to call it “fascinating” and try and compare the ideas it contains with the  writings of Israel critic Peter Beinart. Furthermore when he asks Clinton if  Beinart “gets into all this” he is implying that Clinton is read up on Beinart’s  ideas and works, and Clinton confirms this. Let’s also not forget that Bill  Clinton wrote a wild endorsement of Beinart’s book The Crisis of Zionism, in  which Beinart disgustingly charges Israel with everything from racism to  apartheid-like conditions.Beinart’s writings are completely within the  acceptable spectrum of legitimate approaches toward Israel in Clinton’s  world.The truth is, this article could have been many pages longer. The  accumulated evidence regarding Hillary Clinton’s views on Israel is too much for  one column, and this is only a sampling. It’s important to note that when former  senior adviser to President Barack Obama Dennis Ross wrote his tell-all book  Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.-Israel Relationship from Truman to Obama, he  described a faction within the White House that saw Israel as “more of a  problem” than a partner. Since Clinton describes herself as someone who was a  great friend to Israel in the Obama administration, it becomes downright scary  to imagine what the anti-Israel camp must have looked like.

<title>NO HOLDS BARRED: What’s Richard Branson’s problem with Israel?</title>
<date>25/1/2016</date>
<content>
Richard Branson is the business magnate who heads the venture capital  conglomerate Virgin Group, known best for its Virgin Atlantic airlines and  Virgin Mobile wireless communications brand. He has been dubbed a master at  business and public relations, and has accrued billions through his  dealings.I have met him on a few occasions. Once at Oxford, when he  opened a restaurant with my friend, world-renowned chef Raymond Blanc, and again  at the World Economic Forum in Davos. On both occasions he was friendly,  approachable and very down-to-earth.




But a little known and unfortunate  fact about Branson is his strange anti-Israel opinions and activities, that are  beneath a man known for his good and kind heart.In 2007, Branson founded  an organization called “The Elders” which was made up of a council of 12 elder  statesmen who would serve as “independent global leaders working together for  peace and human rights.” One of the top goals and priorities of this  organization is to inject itself into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and  influence its outcome. Branson sits on the The Elders’ advisory council and uses  his massive wealth to fund the organization. Unfortunately the elders that  Branson selected for his group are a who’s who of some of the most tenacious,  anti-Israel public figures in the world today. The Elders’ anti-Israel  statements and press releases condemning the Jewish state are a sad testament to  this fact.Topping the Elders’ list is former US president Jimmy Carter,  a man dedicated to the disgustingly fraudulent and anti-Semitic proposition that  Israel is an apartheid state. Carter’s defamatory fabrications about the Jewish  state include not only the lie that Israel is like apartheid South Africa but  also that “voices from Jerusalem dominate our media.” Last year he claimed Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t interested in making peace but said of Hamas  arch-terrorist Khaled Mashaal, “I don’t believe that he’s a terrorist. He’s  strongly in favor of the peace process.” It has been shown that the Carter  Center receives tens of millions from countries with appalling human rights  records and which are dedicated to Israel’s delegitimization, including Saudi  Arabia, Oman and the UAE. He also received $500,000 from the anti-Semitic,  terrorist-supporting Zayed Center, whose efforts he went on to praise the  following year.The list of Carter’s actions and statements against the  Jewish state are degrading to the august office of the presidency of the United  States, even if they were stated after the fact.Yet in 2014, Branson  named Jimmy Carter one of his “top five most respected people in the world,” and  a man “ahead of his time.” At a conference in Egypt, Branson introduced Carter  as “perhaps arguably the most remarkable person alive today.” After pressing the  audience to give Carter a second round of applause, Branson announced, “I think  its fair to say that he’s one of the few people in this world who has stayed  faithful to the Palestinians.”Branson is a brilliant man. Does he really  believe that someone who has allowed the Palestinians to continue in their  self-defeating terrorist path is loyal to their cause? Surely Branson is aware  that the only people dedicated to the Palestinians’ welfare are those who  encourage them to democratize, spend money on schools rather than bombs, invest  in universities rather than rockets and teach their children to love their own  heritage rather than hate the Jews.Other “elders” in Branson’s  organization include the notoriously anti-Israel, anti-Semitic Bishop Desmond  Tutu, whom I have also met on several occasions, including at the Oxford  Union.Tutu is a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)  movement, calling for an economic and cultural boycott of Israel. His bigoted  views have surfaced with statements such as, “The Jewish lobby is powerful –  very powerful,” while accusing Jews of “an arrogance – the arrogance of power  because Jews are a powerful lobby in this land and all kinds of people woo their  support.”Tutu has stated that Zionism has “very many parallels with  racism,” and has accused the Jewish state of subjecting the Palestinians to  “Israeli apartheid.” He believes that the Palestinians are suffering more than  the Jews did during the Holocaust, stating that “the gas chambers” made for “a  neater death” for the Jews.Clearly such views are not just a moral  abomination but represent a deplorable and permanent stain on the reputation of  a man who won the Nobel Peace Prize.Is this what Branson had in mind  when he stated in an interview, “And obviously after the Second World War, the  world had enormous sympathy for the Jewish people. Over a number of decades,  that sympathy has been lost”? I believe in my heart that Branson is a good and  charitable man. So why say these things about the Jews? Branson also tapped the  former head of the UN, Kofi Annan, the same man who overruled UN general Romeo  Dallaire in April 1994 and ordered him not to use UN forces to disarm the Hutus  and prevent them from hacking to death 800,000 Tutsis.Annan in the past  declared Saddam Hussein was a man he could do business with, and then sat down  to smoke expensive cigars with the Butcher of Baghdad. He also declared himself  “deeply moved” by the death of arch-terrorist Yasser Arafat and ordered the UN  flag flown at half mast.Included in Branson’s group is the man Kofi  Annan appointed as UN special representative for Afghanistan and Iraq, Lakhdar  Brahimi. During Brahimi’s assignment he criticized Israel’s violence and  suppression of Palestinians and called Israel “the big poison in the  region.”Nice.Branson, apparently, sees eye to eye with  Brahimi.After his 2009 trip to Israel with the Elders, Branson wrote,  “On my return I rang my 92-yearold father and told him of our trip. ‘It’s  strange,’ he said, ‘that the Israel politicians seem to like keeping a wound  open and festering year after year.’” Now, perhaps his father said this out of  ignorance. Perhaps he’s unaware of all the Israeli attempts to make peace with  the Palestinians that ended with thousands of Israelis dead in suicide attacks.  But then Branson ought to know better than the response he gave his father:  “Let’s hope 2009 will be the year that wound is healed.”Branson’s crack  team of peace makers also includes Mary Robinson, the former head of one of the  most corrupt anti-Israel organizations on earth, the UN Human Rights Council.  During her time there, she presided over the Durban “World Conference Against  Racism,” which has gone down in history as one of the vile displays of public  anti-Semitic in recent times. Yet she described the conference as “remarkably  good, including on the issues of the Middle East.”During the Gaza  conflict of 2014 she and Carter wrote a letter arguing for the recognition and  inclusion of Hamas due to the genocidal terrorist group’s “legitimacy as a  political actor.” The Elders had earlier that year praised the Hamas-Fatah unity  government.Robinson’s appointment to the Elders council isn’t  surprising, seeing as how Branson ignored the fact that Hamas has fired over  14,000 missiles at Israeli towns when he said, “Just watching Israel bombarding  Palestine and Palestine sending one or two little rockets over to Israel – it’s  just too sad for words.”Branson also has former president of Finland  Martti Ahtisaari on board, who has said he calls on the Western world to end the  boycott of Hamas.During Ahtisaari’s time with The Elders, he condemned  Israel’s raid on ships to Gaza in a press release that stated, “The Elders  described Israel’s attack on the aid shipment and the resulting killings and  injuries as completely inexcusable.” The UN itself later exonerated Israel in  this matter.But when your agenda is to harm Israel there’s little need  to find supporting facts for your biased claims.Branson has been a very  public figure in the business world. I admire the swashbuckling commercial image  he has cultivated. Why does he have to tarnish his image and his brand with  these anti-Israel statements and associations? Why pour millions of dollars into  activities aimed at harming and weakening the Jewish state? His organization  continues to be a force for the defamation of Israel. Carter recently spoke on  behalf of The Elders stating, “We have also encouraged Europeans for instance,  at least to label products that are made by Israeli people who occupy Palestine  and ship their products out of Palestine to be sold in Europe.... [S]o that the  buyers can decide whether they want to buy them or not.”The time has  come for Richard Branson to follow his generosity of spirit by disassociating  himself with arch-Israel haters, ceasing to fund them, and to begin supporting  and standing behind the Middle East’s only democracy. After all, Israel is not  just the Jewish state. As a bastion of freedom and human rights in the world’s  most tyrannical region, it’s also the great Arab hope that one day Arab  countries will copy its example of liberal democracy and human  rights.

<title>No Holds Barred: Why is eBay’s founder financing Israel-hatred?</title>
<date>17/3/2016</date>
<content>
Pierre Omidyar is the founder of the online auction site eBay. Having gotten into the tech industry at the right time in the late ’90s, his site took off and he is now worth an estimated $8 billion. Omidyar uses his money to support a vast array of causes and he and his wife have fostered the image of caring philanthropists who strive to make the world a better place. I salute the intention. Unfortunately, that same philanthropy is currently being used in an effort to defame and harm the State of Israel.In 2013, Omidyar pledged $250 million to found First Look Media, a news organization that was created with the goal of supporting multiple news publications, the first of which was the online news site The Intercept. However Omidyar’s apparent intention surfaced when he chose Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill as editors for this publication along with Laura Poitras. Greenwald and Scahill are determined foes of Israel.




Greenwald has in the past claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu praised Hitler, has vigorously defended the BDS movement whose goal is the economic destruction of Israel, complained that the US has made it “illegal to broadcast Hezbollah television stations” due to the “Israel-centric stranglehold on American policy,” and made comparisons between Netanyahu’s statements and the words of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels.Scahill has called Israel’s defensive war against Hamas in the summer of 2014 “a massive massacre and one epic series of war crime after war crime,” complained how Obama’s speech to the Turkish parliament in 2009 against Iranian nukes “did not mention Israel once,” refers to the May 2010 Gaza flotilla raid as a “massacre,” and blatantly lied that “Israel has targeted for killing numerous journalists who have reported on the Palestinian side.”The Intercept has shown its anti-Israel bias from day one. In article after article, Israel is attacked and defamed, with no regard to the truth. Given its editors’ backgrounds, and past statements, this comes as no surprise. Here are a sampling of some of outrageous falsehoods peddled by Omidyar’s The Intercept.In an article titled, “Terrorism in the Israeli Attack on Gaza,” Greenwald writes that terrorism is “a fear-mongering slogan” and argues that the State of Israel is the real terrorist while Hamas is simply defending itself from aggression.In the article “Greatest Threat to Free Speech in the West: Criminalizing Activism Against Israeli Occupation,” Greenwald writes, “only advocates of tyranny could support the literal outlawing of the same type of activism that ended apartheid in South Africa merely on the grounds that this time it is aimed at Israeli occupation.” He also states, “If anything, what is actually “anti-Semitic” is to conflate the Israeli government with Jews generally.”Greenwald quotes US Sen. Elizabeth Warren as saying, “When Hamas puts its rocket launchers next to hospitals, next to schools, they’re using their civilian population to protect their military assets. And I believe Israel has a right, at that point, to defend itself,” and this destruction is the “last thing Israel wants.” Greenwald adds, “That, ladies and gentlemen, is your inspiring left-wing icon of the Democratic Party.”In an article by Andrew Fishman titled, “A Left-Wing Hero of Brazil, Jean Wyllys, Comes Under Fire for Israel Trip, Anti-Palestine Comments,” he defends Hamas and mocks the claim that Hamas might harm a foreign dignitary if he were homosexual. He writes, “It is a baseless, cartoonish, fear-mongering distortion of Hamas as a gang of irrational, backwards, blood-thirsty terrorists.” He also complains that “Wylls repeatedly conflated Hamas, the political party that was democratically elected and has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, with ‘ISIS or other criminal gangs’ – a staple of Israeli rhetoric under Netanyahu.”Scahill’s article “The Assassination Complex” complains about drones that target terrorist leaders and insists that rather than being called, “targeted killings,” they should be called “assassination[s].”And The Intercept unsurprisingly features Greenwald interviewing and praising notorious anti-Semite and committed Israel-hater Max Blumenthal in which he is given over 40 minutes to spew his lies and hate against Israel.Other articles include:“WHY IS RE/MAX SELLING PROPERTIES IN ILLEGAL ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS?”“CASH, WEAPONS AND SURVEILLANCE: THE U.S. IS A KEY PARTY TO EVERY ISRAELI ATTACK”“Was a Palestinian Suspected of Killing an American in Israel Executed by the Police?”“COMBAT PROVEN”: THE BOOMING BUSINESS OF WAR IN ISRAEL”“Samples of Israeli Horrific Brutality and War Criminality in Gaza”“OBAMA’S CHRISTIAN RIGHT CRITICS AGREE WITH ISLAMIC STATE”“BENJAMIN NETANYAHU’S LONG HISTORY OF CRYING WOLF ABOUT IRAN’S NUCLEAR WEAPONS”The list goes on and on.One has to ask, what is Pierre Omidyar’s goal in investing so many millions into this anti-Israel, anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist “news” site? Why would he want to harm Israel? Is he hoping to tie the hands of the US government in its war on ISIS? Though Omidyar stepped down as chairman of eBay in 2015, he still owns approximately 10 percent of the company and he uses his gains from the site to fund extremely harmful anti-Israel propaganda.Omidyar may be a generous philanthropist. But he should stop funding anti-Semitic lies about Israel that seek to make it impossible for the Jewish state to defend itself against terrorists like Hamas.

<title>Non-nuclear fallout</title>
<date>21/1/2016</date>
<content>
This week saw the lifting of sanctions against Iran; a speech by US Ambassador  to Israel Dan Shapiro that implied Israel has two different sets of laws in the  West Bank, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians; and an EU statement that  called settlements an obstacle to peace that threatens to make a two-state  solution impossible, but stopped short of a motion that would end all agreements  with Israel at the Green Line.All three can be tied  together.




When US President Barack Obama spoke to the UN General Assembly  in 2013, he said that his two main foreign policy objectives would be to reach a  nuclear accord with Iran and to strive for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.  Now that the first stage of the Iran accord has been signed, sealed and  implemented, Israel can expect to come under concerted pressure over its  settlement policy.The question, as always, is what role will the US play  with exactly one year to the day until the end of Barack Obama’s second  presidency, and how indicative Shapiro’s speech was of the direction American  policy will take.I spoke to Prof. Eytan Gilboa, a senior researcher at  the BESA Center for strategic studies at Bar Ilan University and an expert in  US-Israel relations, to try to understand what the last year of Obama’s  presidency will look like for Israel.Gilboa says Obama will not be a  lame duck president and that the prevailing view that we have just one year to  go and that elections will restrict Obama is wrong.“This is, after all,”  he says “the president who stated he intends to achieve a comprehensive  resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”For Gilboa, statements  by Obama over the past year that he does not expect any breakthrough in talks  between Israel and the Palestinians are mere camouflage.Obama will, he  says, despite all his previous failures, make at least one more effort and  furthermore his final year in office will be motivated by the wish to develop  his legacy and to prepare the ground for his future.There is talk of his  desire to become UN secretary-general.It is in that context that  Shapiro’s remarks should be examined. Gilboa says Shapiro has always been very  careful to maneuver between Netanyahu and Obama and that the sharp tone of his  speech this week to the INSS was likely dictated by the White House and or the  State Department.The gradual increment in rhetoric is a new step in the  American strategy to try to force changes in Israeli policy by applying pressure  on public opinion. The American thinking, says Gilboa, is that if you can get  the EU, human Rights organizations and the UN all to focus on one issue, the  settlements, then you can get Israel to make concessions that will pave the way  for an agreement.It is, says Gilboa, a policy that can only backfire. “I  don’t think the Obama administration has ever understood Israeli public opinion  and politics,” he says. “The more the US and the EU apply pressure, the more we  will see resistance in Israeli society, and secondly, this will strengthen the  Palestinian resistance to make any concession and to make any move that could  facilitate negotiations, let alone an agreement.”Shapiro’s remarks drew  a furious response from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called them  “unacceptable and wrong.” But Netanyahu should not have been surprised. There  really was nothing new in Shapiro’s address, not even his comment on double  legal standards. A look back at Secretary of State John Kerry’s comments to the  Saban Forum in Washington just over a month ago shows similar  rhetoric.Talking about what could happen in the absence of a two-state  solution, Kerry asked: “Would millions of Palestinians be given the basic rights  of Israeli citizens including the right to vote, or would they be relegated to a  permanent underclass? Would the Israelis and Palestinians living in such close  quarters have segregated roads and transportation systems with different laws  applying in the Palestinian enclaves? Would anyone really believe they were  being treated equally?” The Obama administration appears to be amplifying its  tone by questioning not just the legitimacy of the settlement enterprise but the  very rule of law in the West Bank.It is depicting an apartheid reality  that will deepen Israel’s negative image and create further  pressure.“One very strong element of the US-Israeli relationship is  shared values, and that was always an Israeli asset and vis-a-vis Europe as  well. When you begin to question values you really begin to undermine one of the  most significant foundations of the Israeli- American relationship,” says  Gilboa.“What the Obama administration is telling us,” he ads, “ is that  if you continue this way then this could negatively affect one of the most  important foundations of the American-Israeli relationship.”The Kerry  and Shapiro comments and the EU motion, which Israel, for the moment,  successfully managed to tone down with the surprising help of Greece and other  countries, are just the beginning of a major attack on Israeli  policy.
The world has accepted a nuclear-threshold Iran – it hasn’t  accepted the Israeli settlement enterprise.

Fed up with El Al With regard to “El Al crisis continues as pilots refuse to fly  round-trips” (November 21), is it not high time that El Al management and the  pilots woke up to the fact that it might be pointless playing for public  sympathy? There are plenty of alternatives on many routes, and the public is  getting fed up with being treated as pawns. Both management and pilots could  find that they are doing irreparable damage.




No other airline pilots are  treating the traveling public in this manner.

Jerusalem  Placement priorities
 
I was simply amazed to read on the front page of the  November 21 Jerusalem Post “Ramallah’s Christians still make the best hummus,”  while “Israel boycotted in Chilean gathering of diplomats’ wives” was relegated  to Page 10. Where are your priorities? SARA STERZER 
Beit Shemesh The  article “Chief rabbi, Muslim clerics call for end to violence” (November 20)  would have served all of us better had it been on the front page, and not  relegated to Page 4.So long as grassroots diplomacy and “Track 2”  diplomacy are not treated as the worthy and powerful assets they are, their  important and powerful work is diminished. Their voice is decreased, their  essential contributions are lessened, and a bridge between Jews and Arabs is not  fully used.MICHAEL M. COHEN

The writer is a rabbi.A fit  over Trump With regard to “The Trump revolution, Israel and American Jews”  (Candidly Speaking, November 21), the Anti-Defamation League and a slew of other  liberally-bent Jewish advocacy, religious and social organizations are in a fit  over Donald Trump’s election and his appointment of Stephen Bannon, a longtime  opponent of antisemitism and anti-Israelism. They’ve gone so far as to label  Bannon an antisemite on the flimsiest of evidence.What of the  disparaging comments by the Clinton campaign (and the Left in general) against  people of faith, the intelligence of rural America and certain ethnicities? I’m  sure that ADL solicitations are already in the mail, referring to Walmart stocks  of crosses, white hoods and bed sheets being sold out.If my sarcasm  offends, consider the outrageous comparisons of Trump with Hitler, his policies  with fascism and his election with the tragedy of 9/11, as well as accusations  of sympathy for the Ku Klux Klan and the absurdity of shiva rites being  practiced. Particularly haughty are the organizations touting their  “Jewish” bona fides and their fight for alleged “Jewish” values in the  process.American Jewish leadership has presided over one of most  self-destructive periods in Jewish history, resulting in horrendous assimilation  and intermarriage rates at around 70%. Even if you accept attempts to spread the  tent poles ever farther apart to increase the Jewish population, American Jewry  is in decline due to a negative birth rate. The overstretched tent canopy is  shredding.Antisemitism has decimated the Jewish people by  millions. But for all the efforts fighting for Jewish survival against  external enemies, self-inflicted decimation has its millions of victims,  too.At least we in Israel know how to survive as Jews at the most  fundamental level. We consider ourselves and our values worthy of reproduction.  It would seem we are not the ones in need of lectures from our American elitist  brothers on what’s good for Israeli or Jewish survival.

Jerusalem Racism by design? In “Excuse me for asking” (Encountering Peace,  November 17), Gershon Baskin asks how Israel could become the democratic  nation-state of the Jewish people while endlessly confining the Palestinians  under occupation and settlement expansionism. Four Israeli prime  ministers asked the same question and made an apartheid or South Africa  connection, including David Ben-Gurion.JanSuzanne Krasner, the only  reader trying to “answer” this (“Their own questions,” Letters, November 21),  says that states based on nationality, like many in Europe, are “inherently  racist, and... Israel has the same right to protect its nationality.” But  democratic countries originating in nationality are still  egalitarian.Both the Balfour Declaration and the Palestine Mandate  declare that it is “clearly understood that nothing should be done which might  prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in  Palestine.” Israel’s Declaration of Independence says the state will “ensure  complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants  irrespective of religion, race or sex.”Whether based on nationality  (like Sweden) or on internationality (like Israel), is Israel or any country  supposed to be racist?

Cambridge, Massachusetts Conversion tales I  offer two examples to help prove the thesis of Steven M. Cohen in his  discussion of the two types of convert (“Rabbinical vs personal converts to  Judaism: What’s the difference?” Comment & Features, November 17). In  1962, I was given the opportunity to instruct a candidate for conversion. She  was Chinese, and I understood from the sessions with her and her intended that  it was very difficult for his parents. She was an excellent student, with  a deep spiritual quest to be a good Jew. I completed my instruction and she was  converted by a Conservative rabbi.In 1966, my fellow chaplain, Rabbi  David Saltzman, was serving in Vietnam. Often, he would fly to islands where  Jewish soldiers were stationed, some with their wives. He reached one island in  the Pacific and was taken to the home of an Air Force officer. Saltzman enjoyed  a fine kosher meal, all the food flown in. The officer’s Chinese wife asked:  “Where is David Geffen, who was my teacher?” In Wilmington, Delaware, I served  as a rabbi at Congregation Beth Shalom. Two African- Americans came to see  me. They wanted to enter a program of instruction to be converted to  Judaism. One dropped out quickly, but after six months of intensive study, the  other became a Jew.Every Shabbat morning, this man religiously came to  shul. Frequently, he was given an aliya. One Yom Kippur, one of the  people who was to have an aliya became ill. The High Holy Day chairman told me  he was giving the aliya to the convert.On Yom Kippur morning, he was  called to the Torah. Sitting in the last row, with 1,500 attendees, he walked  through the synagogue that morning and chanted the blessings with real  conviction.DAVID GEFFEN

Issues with pot Some people have  decided that cannabis is not so bad. Yet I have heard that in drug rehab  programs, it is usually the cannabis smokers who are the most troubled patients,  often showing a serious, withdrawn intensity coupled with strange conspiracy  theories.There must be good reason why marijuana is banned in virtually  every country. It is also well known that regular users struggle with  motivation. Many move on to harder drugs.Marijuana use could bring out  schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Like drinking and gambling, it can  be harmless fun for many, but other users will develop serious  problems. It is almost like playing Russian Roulette when trying these  things.Criminalizing users is usually counter-productive because they  have enough problems as it is. They mostly need love, not criminal  records or rejection. It is the dealers who should be prosecuted more  harshly.
If there are any medical applications for for the use of marijuana, let us be guided by science rather than folklore so  that it can be used properly.

<title>October 2, 2016: Do your homework</title>
<date>1/10/2016</date>
<content>
Do your homeworkDouglas Bloomfield (“Bluffing for peace,” Washington Watch,  September 29) claims that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set a trap for Abbas  when he invited him to speak at the Knesset. If that were so (which I do not  believe), he’d have every right to do so. Abbas, too, is playing games and  laying traps.




Abbas does not want a twostate solution with the so-called  Palestinians in the West Bank and the Jews in the State of Israel.He has  repeatedly refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. He has adamantly  refused to come to the table to talk peace. He encourages savagery from his  people, and when Israel kills the terrorists he incites, he denounces it for  ethnic cleansing and for being an apartheid state.Why is he doing all  this? Because this method works fine to demonize Israel and get the world so  against the tiny state that – and on this he spins his hopes – Israel will be  forced out from all “Arab lands,” and not only from the West Bank – and forever.  It’s not going to happen, but that’s what he wants.(His game also brings  in billions of dollars, which he is loath to lose.) Mr. Bloomfield should do his  homework.EDMUND JONAH
Rishon LezionFavors TrumpWith regard to “US  presidential debate highlights Iran deal as national security priority”  (September 28), the hootenanny at Hofstra University is history.This is  a change election.Trump has gotten this far because he has correctly  calibrated that the American people want change and constantly call out  politicians of both parties for taking America in the wrong  direction.Yes, Hillary Clinton has a powerful presence and presentation,  but after a long tenure in the public eye, she has developed a fondness for  political power and the many financial perks that apparently go with it (above  board as well as murky). If she still has a soul, it is carefully camouflaged  under a connection to America’s corporate kings and queens.Trump, for  all his many flaws, has a more decisive grasp of the needs and wants of the  American people, most of whom remain uneasy about the future for themselves and  their children.It is this unease that is shaping most voters’  views.As a Jewish voter, I feel that the coldness Clinton evidences does  not bode well for American- Israeli relations. It should be seen as particularly  chilling that as a former secretary of state and senator from the state with the  largest Jewish population in America, she saw fit not to mention Israel by name  even once during the debate, unlike Trump.Donald Trump has a lot of  learning to do. However, as he has shouted from every podium, he wants America  to win.Not for one minute can I imagine Clinton, the candidate of the  status quo, challenging the Obama doctrine of ignoring the truth about Islam  being co-opted by extremists who cite their beliefs again and again as  motivation for their attacks.NEIL BERRO

Hot kitchenLauren Feibelman (“Covering up Jewishness with  duct tape,” Comment & Features, September 28) claims to be “heartbroken” for  those Jews “living in fear and undercover,” and decries the need to “cover up my  Jewishness with duct tape.”As the national associate director of campus  affairs for StandWithUs, by hiding her Star of David and its Hebrew logo on her  backpack, she sets a shameful example of the very thing she laments. The last  thing American Jewish college students need today is to see other young Jews,  especially their leaders, keeping their heads down and running  scared.What they do need is genuine courage. I suggest that Feibelman  follow Harry S. Truman’s advice and get out of the kitchen if she can’t stand  the heat.GERALD FLANZBAUM Hadera As an Israeli living in the Jewish  state, I can’t tell you how much safer I feel knowing that Lauren Feibelman and  Stand- WithUs are looking after our interests.Feibelman actually tells  us that on the advice of her husband, in order to have her “adventure in Italy,”  she covered up her luggage with tape so that there would be no outward sign of  Jewishness, even though she knew that “something was terribly wrong with  this.”In Italy, she noticed “more ‘duct tape,’ more things that were  shielded for safety.” She also noticed “the complete lack of security in the  half-dozen churches we walked into” and the “overabundance of safety measures”  at “every synagogue,” and then realized that she truly felt more nervous than  ever about facing antisemitic hatred in America.“We Jews who live in a  place where we can share our thoughts and opinions freely need to stand up and  take notice of those who can’t, before its too late.... We cannot put our heads  in the sand and hope things get better.”I fear that Feibelman’s head is  well and truly in the sand together with those of all Jews who continue, mostly  through choice, to live in the Diaspora rather than in their very own historic,  Jewish land. You can take the Jew out of the Diaspora, but it’s harder to take  Diaspora out of the Jew.

The writer is a retired  physician.Equal educationBorn and raised in a secular Jewish  environment, my views of Judaism are tinged with democratic values, while my  views of democracy are tinged with Jewish values. I don’t know how to separate  the two.Jews are being asked to focus on prayer this High Holy Day  season, not on education, and on religion, not democracy. Yet some Ashkenazi  religious schools in Israel refuse entry to Mizrahi students (especially girls),  asserting that they aren’t Jewish-enough. In addition, most haredi schools in  Israel avoid state-set minimal requirements for education – students don’t learn  English, math, science and more.Non-Orthodox Jews are being encouraged  to lobby for equal visitation rights at the Western Wall, but they remain silent  on state-endorsed discrimination in Israeli education. Without appropriate  education, the future of Israel is at stake – if the country doesn’t exist, any  access to the Western Wall becomes moot.This High Holy Day season, I’ll  advocate for equal education, as it’s the foundation of any state wanting to  exist beyond this century.JUDY BAMBERGER

<title>October 6, 2016: Text and territory</title>
<date>5/10/2016</date>
<content>
Text and territory The Obama administration’s continued refusal to recognize  Jerusalem as part of the State of Israel (“White House removes ‘Israel’ from  Obama transcript,” October 2) is sadly parallel to its rejection of the most  accurate description of the major threat to world order: radical Islamic  terror.




In both cases, the world’s most powerful nation adamantly opposes  what is abundantly clear to any rational human being, merely in order to avoid  some hypothetical offense to the Arab/Muslim world. In reality, these stances  are paternalistic and counterproductive. Refusing to identify radical Islamic  terror suggests that peaceful Muslims are unable to recognize and deal with the  violent cancer growing within their midst.An accurate diagnosis is the  first step toward ridding the body of an illness before it becomes terminal.  Failure to accurately diagnose the metastasizing threat allows the rest of the  world to paint all of Islam with an overly broad brush while absolving the  Muslim body-politic of any responsibility for its own health.With regard  to Jerusalem, a senior administration official is quoted as stating: “The status  of Jerusalem is an issue that should be resolved in final-status negotiations  between Israelis and Palestinians.”If the US were truly committed to  resolving all issues in this manner, it would not describe settlements in the  disputed territories as “illegitimate” and an “impediment to peace.” Nor would  it call for a two-state solution based on the 1967 armistice lines. Such  policies clearly favor the Palestinian position on fundamental issues from the  outset, and render fair negotiations virtually impossible.Failure to  state definitively Jerusalem’s true character only extends the dispute by giving  Palestinians and the greater Arab community the false hope that Jewish control  of the city is only temporary. The sooner Israel’s enemies come to terms with  our permanent presence in the capital of our national homeland, the sooner they  will be willing to negotiate in good faith on reasonable resolutions of the  remaining issues.EFRAIM A. COHEN 
Zichron Ya’acov The While House  “correction” saying that President Barack Obama attended Shimon Peres’s funeral  in “disputed territory” rather than in Jerusalem was the ultimate insult to the  deceased.It also made Obama’s eulogy a mockery in light of all the  flattering words that came out of his mouth.If Jerusalem is disputed  territory because it was won in a war, then much of the Unites States is  disputed territory, too. After all, it was also acquired as the spoils of war.  To be accurate, therefore, Obama is not president of the United States, but  president of disputed territory.MILTON H. POLIN Jerusalem Won’t change  anything Regarding “Abbas in Jerusalem” (Editorial, October 2), you are critical  of Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett’s position that it was wrong of those  “who lined up to shake the hand of a man who he said ‘encourages the murder of  Israelis.’” You go on to say that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud  Abbas’s presence at Shimon Peres’s funeral was important, calling it “a step in  changing Palestinian perception.”You can’t say that a man who, to this  very day, incites his people to murder Jews has taken an important step in  changing Palestinian perceptions by attending Peres’s funeral. It’s like saying  that by attending the funeral of a fire chief, a person who runs a gang of  arsonists and has not renounced setting things on fire (and you know full well  that he is going to encourage such deeds the following day) will change the  perception of his gang! The same editorial could have been written following the  signing of the Oslo Accords on the White House lawn in 1993, in that Yasser  Arafat’s shaking the hands of Peres and Yitzhak Rabin would change Palestinian  perceptions.

Trump vs Clinton I am perplexed by  my fellow Jews’ support for Hillary Clinton – and for Democrats in  general.President Barack Obama has brought 680,000 inadequately vetted  Muslim migrants into the US, and Clinton has boasted of her plan to bring  100,000 Syrians by the end of 2017 (and that’s just Syrians). Many of them might  be fine, peaceful people, but they have grown up in societies whose governments  and media vilify Jews on a daily basis.To believe they will leave those  ingrained hatreds behind is monumentally naive and dangerous.Clinton  championed the Iran deal and gave Tehran a clear path to becoming a regional  nuclear superpower, thereby creating an existential threat to  Israel.Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida), who chaired the  Democratic Party at the time, chose the deal over her people by supporting the  accord. Sen.Charles Schumer (D-New York) was the only prominent Democrat  brave enough to oppose it.Clinton supports Black Lives Matter, a  movement that has recently taken up the Palestinian cause and called Israel’s  treatment of Palestinians “genocide” and “apartheid.” Her running mate, Tim  Kaine – who, considering Clinton’s recent medical issues, could end up being  president – boycotted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in  2015, as did 50 other Democrats.The Democrats are no longer  Israel-friendly and are supportive of blatantly antisemitic groups and  movements. Why any Jew would support them is beyond me.GARY TAUSTINE
New  YorkI read that Donald Trump has more political offices in Israel than he has  in Florida. This was a shock because he is running for office in  America.More importantly, why would any Jew support a man whom every  swastika-bearer has gotten behind? This puts any Jew supporting Trump in league  with neo-Nazis. Jews supporting Trump must be prepared to answer to their  children and grandchildren as to why they turned their back on their offspring  for their own selfish rationale.These Jews are a disgrace to our  faith.Trump preys on low-information voters, ignorant voters, racist  voters and stupid people.That is his coalition. How can Israelis defend  this man? Will anyone in Israel call out these disgraceful members of our faith?  Trump is a con man who is attempting to use uniformed Israelis in an effort to  sway their friends and relatives in America toward his antisemitic  ways.Those Israelis who support him must understand how they are giving  a free pass to the swastika- bearers of the world who wish to bring back  Hitler’s Final Solution.Keep in mind, too, that Trump’s running mate,  Mike Pence, believes at his core in the Rapture – where Israel must be destroyed  so that the Christian savior can return. He believes this will happen in our  lifetime.His is a sickness as bad or worse than Trump’s.These  are purely evil people, and Israelis must know the truth.MARK KLEIN

<title>Only Way for Israel to Get Peace Is to Make Peace</title>
<date>9/3/2016</date>
<content>
Since signing a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, Israel has seen peace for the past 37 years, a peace that has established mechanisms for security coordination and cooperation. This agreement has enhanced security and stability for Israeli citizens as Israel works with Egypt on not only on intelligence and military matters, but also trade and desalinization.In 1994, when Israel signed another monumental peace treaty, this time with Jordan, a nation on its longest border, it got peace — a peace that has held more than two decades as these two nations engage in meaningful and close security cooperation.




Those treaties have yielded true and lasting benefits for the Israeli people.If Israel makes peace with the Palestinians, it too will get peace and lasting benefits that go well beyond its immediate borders. With an agreement will come enhanced security and economic opportunities for Israelis and Palestinians, as well as opportunities for collaborative efforts in such areas as the environment, energy, security and water usage, and for doors to crack open to peace treaties between Israel and other Arab nations through the Arab Peace Initiative.An agreement means that Palestinians will be better able to raise themselves out of poverty and Israelis will be able to focus more on domestic matters and less on their borders. According to the World Bank, the West Bank and Gaza’s per capita gross domestic product was less than 8 percent of Israel’s. Israel must allow the Palestinians the opportunity to build their own economy, to work with regional partners and engage in international trade.So, why are we waiting?Do we want more deaths on both sides? More misery? More people scrambling for shelter? More international opprobrium for Israel?Israel, with a military that is larger per capita than that of any of its neighbors, has the strength and ability to achieve peace. The question, though, is does Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have the willingness and motivation to do so?Demographic realities offer Israel no choice. If Israel is to remain both a Jewish and a democratic nation, it must reach peace with the Palestinians, and it must do so soon.Insistence on 100 percent of the land will lead to a Jewish homeland with a Jewish minority; a binational state. If Israel wants to maintain its Jewish majority, it has no choice but to relinquish land, and self-governance, to the Palestinians. The framework for such an agreement already exists — and has for decades.Under such a framework — endorsed by the Arab League through the Arab Peace Initiative — Israel would relinquish land in return for peace. Just imagine: Fifty-seven Arab and Muslim countries would establish full diplomatic relations with Israel in return for a comprehensive, and mutually beneficial, peace agreement that ends the occupation.The inescapable truth is that the creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state is not a gift to the Palestinians; it is a gift to the Jewish democratic state of Israel. The only way Israel can remain a Jewish, democratic state is if the Palestinians have a state of their own. Otherwise, in 2020, the population from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River will be only 49 percent Jewish.Giving up land is the only way to prevent Israel from becoming a binational state with an Arab majority and Jewish minority, thereby forcing the homeland to either lose its Jewish character or to become a Jewish-controlled apartheid nation.Israel’s leaders must recognize this demographic time bomb and take action before it’s too late. It’s time for two states for two people, with a demilitarized Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security with a democratic Jewish homeland of Israel.
As we’ve seen with Egypt and Jordan, the only way Israel can have peace is for Israel to make peace.

<title>Opportunities and risks</title>
<date>10/12/2016</date>
<content>
It’s been a month since the historic US election, and shell-shocked political  establishments across the democratic world are still finding their footing amid  the most disruptive populist political phenomenon in generations. Western  societies are rejecting a generation of professional leaders for their failure  to even identify the symptoms of their economic and physical insecurities, much  less diagnose the causes and offer appropriate policy prescriptions.But  this is also a moment in world history that presents enormous opportunity for  smaller nations such as Israel, whose leadership still enjoys relative domestic  political legitimacy. Now is the time for the State of Israel advance its  interests and global stature as a principled, authentic “Light unto the  Nations,” with the assets, experience and positioning to help shape solutions to  the economic and existential security threats that are driving political  upheaval across the democratic world.




First, Israel should draw the right  conclusions from the populist winds. At the United Nations this past September,  Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with appropriate confidence about how “Israel’s  ingenuity in agriculture, in health, in water, in cyber and the fusion of big  data, connectivity and artificial intelligence... is changing our world in every  way,” and noted how “more and more nations see Israel as a potent partner... in  fighting the terrorism of today.”All true, including the fact that  Israel has now established diplomatic relations with 160 nations, and is more  closely aligned with its Arab neighbors than ever before.But this isn’t  enough.2016 will be remembered as the year when the influence of social  media reached an intensity that altered the most basic rules of communication  between citizens and their public servants: Until now, citizens received their  information through a narrow, curated pipeline of media, and if they didn’t like  it, they could write a letter to the editor or vote differently next time.  Donald Trump (and others) figured out how to bypass traditional media channels,  speaking to voters directly, and hearing from them, too. As we first witnessed  in the triumphs of Brexit and Trump, with the Arab Spring movement and this  year’s attempted Turkish coup, social media give everyone an equal voice as  potential influencers in the marketplace of ideas. It’s the ultimate  democracy.The State of Israel is as vulnerable as any other to populist  delegitimization; in its case, though, the source is external. There is a real  danger of Israel’s leadership becoming too complacent in its progress in  improving state-to-state diplomatic relations: It is the narrative of social  media populist influencers (no small thanks to John Kerry’s “apartheid occupier”  characterization) that is sustaining the BDS and other movements that are  eroding Israel’s global legitimacy. Social media enfranchisement is the defining  distributive power avenue and foundation for the delegitimization movement. And,  whereas Israel has always succeeding by “doing what we need to do,” as Hillary  Clinton and her party just learned, it’s a mistake to ignore social  media-powered grassroots voices. Delegitimization needs to be strategically  preempted. The recent social media efforts of the prime minister’s foreign press  secretary, David Keyes, are an important step in this direction.The next  step might be to tailor the message to decapitating what a new Reut  Institute-Anti-Defamation League study calls the “head” of the movement – the  element that will never accept Israel’s right to exist – from a much larger  “body and tail,” including many Diaspora Jews, who, in their anguish for a more  perfect, idealized Israel, and their distance from the complexities of the  Palestinian issues, may be drawn to sympathize with the BDS movement.It  seems unlikely that any Jew takes pleasure in seeing Israel as an “apartheid  occupier.” Let us empathize with their anguish; we Jews are all on the same  side, wanting to improve Israel’s standing in the global narrative by  disempowering the truly “anti-Israel,” who are doing a great job for themselves  (at the moment) by manipulating Diaspora Jews to turn on  themselves.Israeli leaders might, independently and in Israel’s own  interest, take proactive steps on the Palestinian situation, to help de-thorn  the delegitimization movement.There are a range of relatively costless  options for Israel, starting with steps to improve the economy, infrastructure,  security and living conditions of the Palestinians, thereby advancing conditions  for future negotiations (as former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon recently  proposed), to transferring administrative responsibilities for Palestinian  villages, and possibly offering a “signature ready” agreement on final status.  If the Palestinians respond favorably to such initiatives, yalla! – this might  jump-start negotiations; if not, the right social media strategy might help  shine light on the Palestinians’ true conditions and shift the global narrative  from the present disproportionate laying of responsibility on  Israel.Israel can offer a more global leadership contribution in the war  on jihadist terrorism, leveraging its historically superior intelligence,  military and ideological assets to help fight the multi-headed hydra of jihad,  and encourage the development of culturally appropriate governance models (to  exploitive authoritarianism and jihad) in the region. Israel’s interests are  more aligned than ever with those of its Arab neighbors, opening the door for  unprecedented integration and collaboration on issues of concern to both (for  example, stabilizing the Sunni/Shi’ite balance, the Egyptian economy) and to  Israel itself (support with the Palestinians).Finally, Israel is as well  positioned as any market democracy to help address the structural headwinds to  employment, household income growth and consumption arising from aging  populations and robotics/ software displacing human participation in the  workforce.This is the dominant economic pressure driving populist unrest  in the market economies.This is Israel’s moment; Prime Minister  Netanyahu is correct. President-elect Trump has signaled a refreshing new  chapter in Israel’s relations with the United States, and why not with the whole  of the world community?

<title>PARTING SHOT: And the Oscar goes to…</title>
<date>11/2/2016</date>
<content>
It was an “aha” moment.Young Israeli model Nivit Bash, sporting a skimpy  string bikini and big smile, was perched atop the ticket gate at the Azrieli  train station entrance on a busy weekday morning as photographers from the  popular US men’s magazine Maxim snapped away.




The 2007 shoot, including  other models like future star Gal Gadot, was for a PG-rated spread that appeared  a few months later titled “Women of the Israel Defense Forces.” I wasn’t there  solely in an ogling capacity, but as representative of my organization –  ISRAEL21c – that partnered with the Foreign Ministry to successfully pitch the  concept to Maxim and then organized and financed the journey to Israel for the  magazine’s team.Sexist? Very likely.Inappropriate for a country  like Israel, that prides itself on being steeped in religion and history?  Perhaps.An effective tool to condition American males aged 18-26 to  connect thoughts of Israel with images of babes? Slam dunk! The resulting photo  spread generated a huge response – both from those calling the effort an  innovative way to promote Israel and from those who were outraged that Israel’s  ample assets being touted were not the Kotel and the Dead Sea.The ‘aha’  moment for me was the realization that Israel was for once not being seen  through the prism of terrorism or conflict, nor history or religion, but being  portrayed as simply a fun, vibrant place that boasted, among other natural  resources, beautiful women.Memories of that photo shoot emerged this  week following the announcement that the Tourism Ministry was participating in  the cost and organization of a $55,000 VIP trip-for-two to Israel being  presented to the 26 nominees of this month’s main Academy Awards  categories.The gift was just one of a plethora of luxury items in the  $200,000 Oscar gift bag arranged by Los Angeles exclusive gift packaging company  Distinctive Assets.Among them were swag like a 15-day walking tour of  Japan ($45,000), a laser skin-tightening procedure ($5,500), a lifetime supply  of skin creams from Lizora ($31,000), and something called the “Vampire Breast  Lift,” described as “the new secret ‘must have’ in Hollywood” using  “blood-derived growth factors to revive rounder cleavage without  implants.”But even that outlandish item failed to prompt reactions like  the elite trip to Israel. Ironically, it provided a rare common rallying point  for both staunch Zionists and BDS activists.The latter predictably and  unimaginatively focused on the smoke screen Israel was attempting to create  through bribery to hide its policies of occupation and apartheid.The  former took offense to the revelation that Israel’s very own Tourism Ministry  was footing $18,000 for the land arrangements for each of the 26 golden tickets,  including hotels, transportation, guides and activities (the first-class air  fare is courtesy of a Brooklyn-based tour company run by Orthodox Jews called  ExploreIsrael.com).Why, they asked, should the likes of megastars like  Matt Damon and Jennifer Lawrence receive private tours of Masada and the Chagall  Windows and dine in the country’s poshest restaurants on the taxpayers’ dime –  especially when they could cover the costs themselves with chump change? The  clear and reasonable response to subsidizing potential visits to Israel by Cate  Blanchett or Bryan Cranston emerged, surprisingly enough, from a government  minister.“If they do indeed accept the invitation, their visit will have  enormous resonance among millions of fans and followers, including social media.  The very fact that they are considering visiting Israel places the option in the  public discourse in the social and professional circles in which the stars  move,” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said in a statement.He’s right on  target. Let’s face it, the perception of Israel in the US is predominantly  defined by its relationship with the Palestinians.Ask your average  Middle American to play a word association game – if you say “Israel,” they’ll  say “conflict.”That is, unless they say “terrorism,” “bomb” or  “Gaza.”If a publicity shot of Leo DiCaprio swiping hummus with pita in  Jaffa or a gossip item about Mark Ruffalo driving a jeep in the Judean Desert  can move the needle ever so slightly in shifting how Israel is perceived by the  world, then the benefit of that $18,000 outlay is priceless.Some may  call that whitewashing, but actually, the opposite is taking place. It’s adding  color to an Israel that has historically been seen only in terms of black and  white.Guess what? The conflict is here to stay. Just ask our prime  minister and our opposition leader, who uncharacteristically agreed this week  that a two state solution is not in the cards for the foreseeable  future.We can’t ignore the dire situation we are in with the  Palestinians, but at the same time, we can’t dwell on it or become defined by  it. Like most countries – actually much more than most countries – Israel is  multi-dimensional. We are the Kotel, the Start-Up Nation, the people of  innovation, the cradle of civilization, a bastion of democracy. However, due to  the incessant emphasis on the ongoing unrest, we’ve succumbed to the widely held  notion that it is one-dimensional.So, embrace the premise of the Oscar  gift bag. Break out your spiffiest duds to impress Jennifer and Matt if they do  end up redeeming their voucher for their 10-day trip to Israel.And, for  God’s sake, stop writing about the conflict on Facebook and Twitter. Israel’s  image is hanging in the balance, by a string... bikini.

<title>Parting Shot: With friends like these</title>
<date>13/10/2016</date>
<content>
The announcement last week that former Portuguese prime minister Antonio  Guterres was slated to succeed Ban Ki-moon as secretary-general of the UN was  met by sighs of relief in Jerusalem.Guterres is a “friend of Israel,”  went the general assessment.




Former prime minister Ehud Barak told Army  Radio that he was sure Guterres would be “fair.”“His views are closer to  those of [Israeli writer] Amos Oz than [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. His  stances reflect those of the world. The world’s view of Israel is that it hopes  to see a different Israel. If the government would act differently, it could  change how Israel is seen,” said Barak, who visited Guterres in Portugal while  both were prime ministers of their respective countries.Which leads to  the question, what exactly constitutes a “friend of Israel”? What are the  criteria that define who can be called a friend of the country? It could mean  someone who defends Israel against unjust claims of apartheid and BDS campaigns  aimed at delegitimizing any efforts to welcome the country into the community of  nations. That would sure qualify as a friend of Israel, and that seems to be how  Barak assessed Guterres’s approach.However, it seems that more often  than not, the term “friend of Israel” has been co-opted by those in the  nationalist camp to refer to public figures whose views qualify them as fellow  card-carrying Greater Land of Israel advocates.These “friends” are firm  believers in Israel’s narrative as the only valid path to justice in the  conflict with the Palestinians, and are firm detractors of anyone who might  claim that the Israel’s elected leaders are perhaps not so sincere or interested  in promoting a solution that would result in a Palestinian  state.“Friends” of Israel bankroll projects to move Jews into  predominantly Arab areas of Jerusalem and they bankroll newspapers that never  say a bad word about the government.Are these Israel advocates, who pull  longs strings from abroad, really doing us a favor by forwarding the agenda of a  minority in Israel that aims to eliminate any chance of reconciliation with our  neighbors? Contrast them with public figures who understand the complexities of  the region and of Israel’s security challenges, legitimate fears and complex,  robust society encompassing varied, valid viewpoints.Sure, it can be  galling to hear a President Obama or a Ban Ki-moon chide Israel like a stern  parent who knows better than us what is good for the country. And what’s with  those State Department condemnations of Israel’s settlement expansion that use  the same language reserved for Syrian civil war mass killings? But the root of  that divisive language and criticism is the underlying tenet that Israel is only  hurting itself and its standing in the world by continuing this myopic policy of  continuing settlement building without seeking a permanent solution.
A  true friend is someone who is willing to tell you something for your own good  that you may not want to hear. Unlike the Israelright- or-wrong ideologues,  that’s the kind of “friend of Israel” that’s worth hanging on to.

<title>Pessin affair exposes Connecticut College anti-Semitism</title>
<date>3/2/2016</date>
<content>
A pro-Israel professor won’t be on campus at Connecticut College when classes start Monday, missing the second straight semester since his 2014 Facebook post criticizing Hamas led to death threats and ostracism.Andrew Pessin “requested and received a sabbatical for the Spring semester to continue his studies in Jewish philosophy and Israel studies,” Connecticut College spokeswoman Pamela Serfes said in an email last week. “He has been and continues to be a valued member of the Connecticut College faculty.”




The vague and misleading statement glosses over the intensity of the campaign against Pessin. He first took a medical leave last spring as a smear campaign against him peaked. The controversy exposed an administration unwilling to enforce its own honor code to protect a professor against anti-Israel activists and a student journalist responsible for covering the very controversy she had joined.It started with an August 2014 Facebook post written as Israel and Hamas fought their latest war, in which Pessin referred to Hamas as “a rabid pit bull chained in a cage, regularly making mass efforts to escape.”It wasn’t until March that the comment suddenly resurfaced to ignite a campus firestorm. On March 2, three editorials condemning Pessin were published in the print and online editions of Connecticut College’s student newspaper, College Voice. The op-eds, which started on the front page and covered all of page three and part of page four, accused Pessin of racism and comparing Palestinians to rabid dogs.Not so, the professor insisted. He was talking about the Hamas terrorists who govern the territory, but the Voice reportedly didn’t bother to give him a chance to present his side.Pessin, a heretofore popular philosophy professor, stood accused of peddling “hate speech.”“I feel unsafe,” Lamiya Khandaker wrote, not really explaining how a Facebook post from the previous summer that hardly anyone had noticed suddenly threatened her security. She did note that she had contacted Pessin, who repeatedly tried to explain that she had misunderstood his comments.Khandaker is an activist with Students for Justice in Palestine, an aggressively anti-Israel organization active on campuses nationwide.Two other students, Michael Fratt and Katilyn Garbe, co-authored an article falsely alleging that “Pessin directly condoned the extermination of a people.”Ayla Zuraw-Friedland, the Voice’s editorin- chief, reportedly authored an anti-Pessin petition, thereby actively participating in the very controversy covered by her newspaper.The Voice also posted anti-Semitic reader comments, which still can be seen. For example, one commenter wrote: “your universities and colleges are owned by Aipac...the zionists [sic] who control America and its foreign policy, apart from its banks, media and movie business.” Another wrote that “student senators have been bullied by Zionist ideologues and moneychangers” and called Pessin “an unapologetically racist bigot who likes the perks of being buddies with Israeli colonists who torture, maim and kill unarmed Palestinianns [sic] with impunity.”In April, George Mason University law professor David Bernstein uncovered evidence that Pessin’s Facebook post had clearly referred to Hamas all along and wrote that “the whole controversy [looked like it had been] ginned up to score anti-Israel political points.”Pessin’s isolation and vulnerability were undoubtedly intensified by the school’s small size: only about 1,900 students attend this private, liberal arts college located in New London.He declined to comment for this story.However, his wife, Gabriella Rothman, expressed frustration at the witch hunt waged against her husband, and the disappointment in the lack of support from colleagues and the university community.As the controversy erupted, school officials “pressured him not to speak or tell anyone that his post was being misunderstood out of context,” she said. “I believe because it was trying to appease the students.”A bias complaint filed against him remained active, but officials wouldn’t tell Pessin what consequences he might face from it.“He was worried his job was on the line,” she said. “So he did what they told him to do.”The couple contacted the FBI and local law enforcement about the death threats he had received, “and for two months we literally felt under siege,” Rothman said.Making matters worse, some of Pessin’s “closest friends at the college joined the mob of condemnations in a heartbeat, even though they knew that the post was about Hamas. “Not one of them stood up and said to the mob, wait a minute, this post is not racist or hate speech. Not one stood up and said, let’s not rush to judgment, let’s wait to hear his side of the story.”Pessin went on medical leave before the Spring semester ended. He has not taught since.Exacerbating the harm to Pessin, the administration chose to host statements from scores of academic departments, school officials, student associations and other college affiliates condemning Pessin on the official Connecticut College website. As of Wednesday, no other issue or speech in the university community is similarly scrutinized or condemned on the school’s official website. Such selective outrage highlights the anti-Semitic climate on campus – in this case, directly enabled by the administration – and the dangers of the ironically mistitled “Office of the Dean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion,” which hosts the anti-Pessin statements.The administration has apparently taken no disciplinary action against any of the students who, in their efforts to defame Pessin, likely violated Connecticut College’s Honor Code, which requires students to act “with integrity, civility, and the utmost respect for the dignity of all human beings.”Instead, the administration appears to have awarded the “Scholar Activist Award” to none other than Lamiya Khandaker – the driving force behind the campaign against Pessin and one of the most vocal anti-Israel activists on campus. This fact was discovered via Lamiya Khandaker’s LinkedIn profile (a screenshot of which was taken, in case her profile is subsequently edited).Apparently, the school chose to honor a student who (as originally reported by Daniel Greenfield) “accused Israel of ‘genocide,’” scoffed at anti-Semitism “and even claimed that ‘Starbucks supports occupation and apartheid,’” and whose anti-Pessin writing violated the school’s honor code.School officials refused to confirm or deny granting the award. What are they hiding? Maybe it’s time for the administration to admit the basic policy underlying their conduct throughout the Pessin affair: anti-Israel voices are to be encouraged, while pro-Israel voices are to be condemned and silenced. They seem to have won: Pessin is silent and nobody knows when he’ll be back on campus.

<title>Petty Arab apartheid, Olympic-style</title>
<date>10/8/2016</date>
<content>
In the bad old days in South Africa, “petty apartheid” was the term used for the  daily oppression and humiliation of blacks through separate public water  fountains, bathrooms, buses, cafeterias and similar facilities. This strictly  enforced separation was a sign of the black population being viewed as subhuman. Since 1948, petty apartheid has also been a feature of the widespread Arab  rejection of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. This practice is  ongoing and is often taken for granted and ignored, as was the case of South  Africa for many years.




For example, on Friday, just before the opening of  the Rio Olympics, the bus provided by the International Olympic Committee picked  up the 10-member Lebanese team and then went to pick up the Israeli team. The  Lebanese blocked the Israelis from entering the bus, and according to media  accounts team captain Salim al-Haj Nakoula “demanded that the door be closed on  the Israeli team, but they ‘insisted on getting on.’” Haj Nakoula continued: “I  then stood at the door of the bus to prevent the Israel team from entering and  some of them tried to go in and pick a fight.”The chronology was  confirmed by the Israelis, who told the Olympic Committee officials that if the  Lebanese could not stomach riding with Israelis, “They were welcome to take  another bus.” After the brief standoff, however, and in order to avoid a violent  confrontation, the Israeli team backed down and agreed to ride a different  bus.This is petty apartheid – practiced against Israel and Israelis on a  daily basis, year in and year out, for 68 years, and still going strong. It is  not a minor and childish “spat” as depicted in some media headlines (“Olympics  spat as Lebanese stop Israelis joining them on bus,” Associated Press, The  Washington Post) – but rather similar to the refusal to allow blacks in South  Africa before 1994, or in the US before the civil rights movement, to sit with  whites on buses or drink from the same water fountains.Many Israelis  have experienced this racism in one form or another.I have been at  academic conferences and diplomatic receptions around the world where  Palestinian, Tunisian, Saudi and Iranian panelists, including government  officials, have avoided shaking my hand or even acknowledging my standing as an  Israeli Jew.In cultural and sporting events, including previous Olympic  Games, Arabs and Iranians have gone to great lengths to avoid being  “contaminated” by Israelis, suddenly withdrawing from events, even when they  would automatically lose as a result. In 2008, swimmers from Syria and the  Islamic Republic of Iran took this route, and during the 2012 London Olympics,  the Lebanese judo team went as far as refusing to practice in view of the  Israelis, forcing organizers to erect a separation barrier (an Arab “apartheid  wall”). In Rio, a Saudi judoka suddenly dropped out, apparently to avoid facing  an Israeli.The so-called international community, including the Olympic  Committee, has, at most, reprimanded the boycotting teams and athletes, becoming  a willing accomplice to anti-Israel apartheid.In previous displays of  this racism, no action was taken against the Syrian, Iranian and Lebanese teams  and no penalties exacted to create a deterrent or express opposition.In  these frameworks, like the United Nations and the International Committee of the  Red Cross, the 57 members of the Islamic bloc (formally known as the  Organization of Islamic Cooperation), including the wealthy oil producers,  control the agendas and have veto power over the officials.Similarly,  the self-appointed guardians of human rights, including NGO superpowers such as  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, are silent when Israelis are the  victims. Indeed, they are very active in promoting the apartheid inherent in the  boycott movement, which is the current Western embodiment of the Arab League’s  economic boycott of Israel. The anti-Israel campaigners in the democratic West  who wrap themselves in the façade of human rights and opposition to racism are  part and parcel of this apartheid.
In Lebanon, whose government and  society is subject to intimidation by the Hezbollah terrorist organization,  Minister of Youth and Sport Abdel Motaleb al-Hennawi praised Nakoula’s actions  in Rio as “principled and patriotic.” Not surprisingly, Hezbollah noted that  “the Israelis were sent away from the bus because normalization [with Israel] is  not to be had in any form, and because the Lebanese identity [is that of]  resistance. Be proud to be Lebanese.” As in the case of South Africa under the  apartheid regime, contact with Israelis is treated as a form of impurity, and  petty apartheid remains the norm.

<title>Reality Check: The immediate benefits of stable government</title>
<date>3/7/2016</date>
<content>
Looking at the mess left in Britain following the electorate’ shock decision to  pull out of the European Union, for once we Israelis can bask in the relative  stability of our own political system. For the first time in decades, Israel has  a government coalition whose members, broadly speaking, see eye-to-eye with each  other on the major issues facing the country.Unfortunately, in the long  term, this most right-wing government in Israel’s history will likely lead the  country to disaster. As the report issued this weekend by the Quartet on the  Middle East (the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United  Nations) highlights, the two-state solution is in danger due to continued  Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.




Most pertinently, the  report notes that continued settlement expansion and the designation of land in  the West Bank for exclusive Israeli use “raises legitimate questions about  Israel’s long-term intentions,” adding that this is “compounded by the  statements of some Israeli ministers that there should never be a Palestinian  state.”Since Benjamin Netanyahu returned to the Prime Minister’s Office  in 2009 and made his famous Bar-Ilan speech in which he pledged his allegiance  to the idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, his  successive governments have worked assiduously to ensure it will never happen.  As the Quartet report points out, between 2009 and 2014, the West Bank settler  population has increased by over 80,000, including at least 16,000 deep in the  West Bank.Overall, according to the report’s figures, there at least  370,000 Israelis living in some 130 settlements in Area C of the West Bank  (which forms around 60 percent of the whole area and is under almost complete  Israeli control), including at least 85,000 deep in the West Bank. At a certain  point, if not already, this mass of Israeli presence in Palestinian territory  makes the possibility of Palestinian statehood a non-starter.Given the  extensive settler lobby at the heart of Netanyahu’s government, we all know what  Israel’s response will be to the Quartet’s call to “cease the policy of  settlement construction and expansion, designating land for exclusive Israeli  use, and denying Palestinian development.”The government will seize on  the first half of the report which rightly condemns the Palestinian Authority  and its leadership for not doing enough to fight terrorism, stop incitement and  condemn attacks, and conveniently ignore its second half, which concentrates on  the negative impact of Israel’s settlement activity.BUT WHILE Netanyahu  knowingly leads the country into an apartheid-style state, the platform his  stable government provides does lend to some short-term advantages, for example  the welcome rapprochement with Turkey.Had the terms of the deal been  presented to the Israeli public in the form of a referendum, there can be no  doubt it would have been rejected. The idea of paying compensation to the  families of Turkish militants killed by IDF soldiers during the raid on the Gaza  flotilla is hard to swallow, particularly when the deal also failed to secure  the return of the remains of IDF soldiers who fell during the 2014 Gaza  war.It’s easy to imagine how, had Netanyahu, Defense Minister Avigdor  Liberman and Education Minister Naftali Bennett been in opposition, they would  have incited the masses against this agreement, calling it cowardice, giving in  to terrorism and groveling to Turkey.Instead, Liberman and Bennett  meekly voiced their opposition to the deal for the record, while Netanyahu  lobbied hard for its acceptance by the cabinet.In fact it was opposition  leader Isaac Herzog who, in another badly placed move, attacked the deal in a  Facebook post, arguing that “restoring relations with Turkey is an important  diplomatic goal but compensating the attackers of IDF troops is  inconceivable.”Really? Would a Herzog-led government not done exactly  the same thing if it enabled the restoration of ties with one of the leaders of  the Sunni Muslim world and a vital player in the front against Iran? There are  times, hard though it may be for Netanyahu’s critics on the Left to admit, that  the prime minister is right, and the deal with Turkey is one of them. One can  criticize Netanyahu for taking so long to achieve it, given it could have been  made on more or less the same terms some years earlier, but better late than  never.With the Middle East in chaos, some regional stability is of the  utmost importance, and an alliance with Turkey will help in this  regard.Alongside the rapprochement with Jerusalem, Ankara is also  seeking to improve relations with Cairo, replacing what Turkish President Recep  Tayyip Erdogan once labeled a “moral foreign policy” with one that is markedly  more pragmatic.In this, the lure of the Leviathan oil and gas fields in  the Eastern Mediterranean, in which Israel is a major player, has also been a  major factor, as a potential joint pipeline deal with Israel, Egypt and Cyprus  could solve, almost overnight, Turkey’s over-dependence on Russia for its energy  needs.The deal with Turkey might not have passed the public popularity  test, but it is an important one for Israel’s diplomatic and economic future.  Sometimes, as British prime minister David Cameron discovered to his cost, it’s  best not to ask the people what they think.

<title>RIGHT FROM WRONG: How dare Europe applaud a blood-libeler?</title>
<date>26/6/2016</date>
<content>
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas lies about Israel not only as a  matter of course but also as a matter of policy. It was no surprise, then, when  he stood up at the European Parliament on Thursday and regurgitated a claim made  this week that rabbinical figures in the Jewish state had urged the government  to poison Palestinian wells.Abbas knew that this classically  anti-Semitic blood libel was as false as a similar one, spread last week, saying  that Israel forced Palestinians from a certain village to flee by drying up  their water supply during Ramadan. In fact, a pipe had burst, and it was  immediately repaired. But not – as media watchdog HonestReporting pointed out –  before the “water apartheid” lie, first “reported” by Al Jazeera, was picked up  by The Independent, the International Business Times, Radio New Zealand and The  Times of London.




In keeping with the tradition of his predecessor, the  late PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Abbas encourages the invention of all kinds of  blood libels, which he then states as fact, both to his own people and to the  international community. Each libel is more ludicrous than the previous one, and  they would be funny if they weren’t reminiscent of Nazi propaganda and didn’t  serve the same purpose: to foster the kind of Jew-loathing that enables  genocide.But annihilating Israel and the Jews is not the real reason  that Abbas perpetuates utterly insane accusations against the only democracy in  the Middle East. More immediate personal concerns preoccupy the PA leader, who  knows his days are numbered, literally and figuratively, if he does not remain  relevant at home and abroad. Indeed, Abbas constantly faces the possibility of  being ousted by members of his own faction, Fatah, and by Hamas, the terrorist  organization that rules Gaza. He manages to survive by enlisting financial and  political support from the United States, Europe and the United  Nations.Viewed – baselessly – as a moderate who constitutes the best  hope for reaching a peace deal with Israel, he continues to be received by world  leaders and to keep the cash flowing into his coffers. That hardly any of it  goes to building institutions in the PA or to rehabilitating Gaza appears to be  of little concern to those holding the position that Abbas is more of a victim  than a perpetrator.What his apologists fail to see, however, is that if,  by some miracle, the two-state solution were to be realized by its fantasists,  Abbas would instantly be thrown into the dumpster of history in every respect.  The only thing unclear about “the day after” is whether his corpse or his  irrelevance will come first.In other words, Abbas has nothing to gain  and everything to lose in any peace deal with Israel. He knows better than  anyone that his status as a leader on the world stage depends precisely on the  absence of Palestinian statehood. Yes, it is this that drives his every move and  all his lies. Key among these lies are the two fictions he reiterates from every  podium, including the one he occupied in Brussels on Thursday. One is that  Middle East stability rests on resolving the conflict between Israel and the  Palestinians.The other is that Israel, being responsible for the  predicament in the first place, bears the burden of repairing the  damage.It therefore infuriates him every time the Israeli government  urges him to come to the negotiating table, leading him to spin any overture  from Jerusalem to his own advantage. His latest such act was to snub President  Reuven Rivlin’s invitation to meet in the European capital.None of this  is the least bit new. In fact, at this point, it is so obvious as to be boring.  In any case, most Israelis are too busy trying to avoid being stabbed, shot or  hit with firebombs to listen to Abbas’ blather. Our blood is actually being  spilled.We don’t need libels or lip service to highlight that  reality.But why does anyone else still treat Abbas as a man of integrity  and stature? How could hundreds of EU Parliament members applaud his vile  speech, when faced with the truth about Islamist terrorism? Where do they get  off believing a single word he says? By now, what any sane representative of a  free country should grasp is that it is not Palestinian wells being poisoned,  but rather the hearts and minds of the Palestinian people.

<title>Roseanne Barr: How a Hollywood great chose morality over personal success</title>
<date>2/5/2016</date>
<content>
On the 18th of Adar II 5776, March 28, 2016, four days after Purim, legendary Hollywood TV star and comic genius Roseanne Barr took to the podium at the Ynet and Yediot Aharonot anti-BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) conference.Within 18 minutes, she emerged as a moral giant and Jewish heroine, one of a long line of Jewish women and men that have saved our nation from destruction. (I am sure she belongs to the Hadassah ladies of Utah.) And as Queen Esther said to Mordecai, “And so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish” (Book of Esther 4:14), Barr began to speak, launching an 18-minute onslaught of such moral outrage, truth and clarity that could have ruined her career and standing within the radical-left-controlled kingdom of Hollywood. Nonetheless, she spearheaded an offensive strike against BDS, presenting to the world community the so-called “human rights” movement as a right-wing, fascist and anti-Semitic ideology hijacking the noble aspirations of the true Left to manipulate and brainwash innocent minds and hearts to destroy Israel via political means.




And as Queen Esther placed nation ahead of personal survival, Barr placed her sisters and brothers – her Jewish family – ahead of personal gain. And as I viewed her speech, I recalled the countless Torah sermons delivered by my rabbis in my yeshiva years about the power of all human beings, especially Jews, to transform their lives. Their ability to summon the courage to place aside self-interest for their love of God, Torah and fellows as personified by Moses. “And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens” (Exodus 2:11) flashed before my eyes.I sat stunned and motionless in the face of this incredible display of conviction, honesty and humility. Here was a well-established icon of American culture, who had reached the pinnacle of prestige, wealth and success, now leading the charge to battle modern- day anti-Semitism, in its guise of emotionally charged trigger words employed by BDS: “apartheid,” “human rights,” “ethnic cleansing,” “colonialism” and “justice.”While many have made movies about the Holocaust, which is extremely important, she is striving to prevent a new Shoah.Citing chapter and verse of the BDS playbook and then brilliantly revealing and destroying the diabolical subversive message of “Free, Free Palestine from the river to sea” – the secret code for “destroy the Jewish state,” Barr drew a line in the sand for all those of great wealth and success, to choose what is right over social blackmail.For BDS is a new form of social blackmail that bullies others, especially Jews, who want to be liked by their non-Jewish peers. Fear of “not fitting in” coerces them to kowtow to anti-Zionism, fearing that otherwise they will not be socially accepted and regarded as “cool.” As BDS bullies ordinary Jews, it more so threatens and bullies Jews of prestige to turn their backs against their nation, fearing a backlash. But as Mordecai commanded Esther: “Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews” (Esther 4:13), Barr did not fall into the snare of self-delusion that traps successful Jews into thinking that they can escape the monstrous tentacles of the Hamans of the world by staying quiet or even joining the BDS bandwagon. We need only remember how the successful Jews of Shushan attended Ahasuerus’s banquet to celebrate the destruction of the First Temple.Then they were still sentenced to extermination by Haman. We can recall the countless number of German and Russian cinema and stage artists who lost their lives and livelihoods, thinking they could escape the Nazi death machine and Soviet communist party, respectively, only to be liquidated in the end with everyone else.As she related her personal journey as the non-typical looking Jew, privy and subjected to the two-faced anti-Semitic bigots encountered on her presidential campaign trail, she unmasked not only the fake “Left” but importantly the treacherous “fake Jews” who would sell out their very nation and its destiny, to be a light unto the nations, for their pot of gold and comfortable life – a malady dating back to our days of the murmurers of old in the wilderness: “And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to lusting and the children of Israel also wept on their part, and said: ‘Would that we were given flesh to eat! We remember the fish which we were wont to eat in Egypt for naught; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic...” (Numbers 11:4-5).These modern day murmurers – J Street, Jewish Voice for Peace, Jews for Justice for Palestinians – have abandoned their Israeli Jewish brethren, surrounded on all fronts by tunnel terrorists, knife-wielding murderers, global boycotts, Iranian-funded missiles and a cultural ethnic cleansing movement that claims the Jews are not an indigenous people that have miraculously returned home.Even Hitler and his henchmen did not go so far. These fake Jews of the radical Left from the above-mentioned NGOs and the BDS movement have conspired together with the anti-Semites of the world, to eradicate not only the one Jewish state, but to send the Israeli Muslim, Christian, Druse and any other non-conformist individual back to the Middle Ages to live under PA/Hamas law. As Barr engaged in battle, I beheld all the Jewish mothers since the time of our Matriarch Sarah, who, like mighty mother lionesses, stood their ground and proclaimed to the world, “My son, Yitzhak, will not be bullied, humiliated, abused and used!” “And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport. Wherefore she said unto Abraham: ‘Cast out this bondwoman and her son ” (Genesis 21: 9-10). So within 18 minutes of penetrating analysis, Barr has raised the bar high for all Jewish mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, professionals and laymen, Hollywood figures and others, to answer to the call. “Silence? Never Again!” Barr, I am with you, our beloved sister! Charge!

<title>Salomon Benzimra: A terrible loss for the Jewish people</title>
<date>17/3/2016</date>
<content>
I  had the honor of joining Salomon Benzimra and Goldi Steiner, co-founders of  Canadians for Israel’s Legal Rights, to speak to members of Knesset and ask them  to proudly proclaim Israel’s legal rights under international law – rights that  clearly state Israel’s borders run from the river to the sea.Salomon was  not a lawyer by vocation but he was one by avocation.




He is the author of  the book, The Jewish People’s Rights to the Land of Israel, published in 2011,  which was endorsed by Moshe Ya’alon, now the minister of defense.He had  spent the last seven years immersing himself in the legal intricacies of  Israel’s borders and rights, following in the footsteps of the late Howard  Grief, and Edmund Levy, former Supreme Court justice, who prepared his report on  Israel’s legal rights under International law at the behest of Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013; a report which was never released. These men had  hoped to stop the accusations of “occupier” and “apartheid” that are based on a  spurious, fictitious narrative of a people that does not exist, and of a state  that was never legally declared.Salomon was particularly concerned  because of recent events: The pope embracing the terrorist Abbas and the idea of  a Palestinian state, and the French calling for the same thing. And then the  arrival of US Vice President Joe Biden in Israel to tell the Jewish people where  we can and cannot live, as if the Jewish people would ever go back to a  ghetto.Benzimra eloquently and brilliantly explained to Deputy Foreign  Minister Tzipi Hotovely the legal justification for declaring Israel’s true  borders in order to stop the wanton murder of Jews around the world and the  attacks on Jewish students on Diaspora campuses because of the false Palestinian  narrative that has taken hold over the past 25 years. He came to Israel with the  hope that he would find a champion with the courage to speak truth to the Jewish  people and stand up to those who were prepared to sacrifice the Jews for “peace”  in the Middle East. He had hoped that Mme Hotovely would be that  champion.After our meeting with the deputy minister of foreign affairs,  Salomon and I began work on a piece for The Jerusalem Post. I wanted to title  the piece to be “J’accuse the Israeli government of crimes against humanity,”  crimes against its own people. Salomon, following in the footsteps of his  biblical namesake, Israel’s most humble and brilliant leader, said, “No, that  would be cruel.”Instead he said I should accuse the Israeli government  of “protracted negligence and dereliction of duty,” because it had had an  opportunity to proclaim its rights in 2013 and perhaps stop the murder of Jews  in Israel and the Diaspora which are constantly justified by the UN and the EU  as being the result of the “occupation.”He then spoke to Education  Minister Naftali Bennett about the need to proclaim Israel’s legal rights under  international law, speaking at the same time as the civics books Bennett had  commissioned, which included eight new chapters on Israel and its legal rights,  were released.We left these meetings without any  assurances.Salomon, a resident of Toronto who was born in 1943 in what  is now Morocco, died on the El Al plane on the way home to Canada on  Tuesday. I think it was from a broken heart.Am Yisrael has lost a  true Lion of Judah with the death of this brilliant but humble man who spent the  last years of his life fighting for the Jewish people.It is truly sad  that the people of Israel did not know the name of this man or the work he had  done.In honor of his love for our people, his determination to defend us  from lies about our people, I suggest that Am Yisrael rise up in his name and  demand of the government that it finally declare and proclaim Israel’s legal  rights under international law, and in the words of Salomon Benzimra, “Tell the  world there will be no negotiating until the territorial sovereignty of Israel  and Judea Samaria is no longer questioned.”Benzimra was buried at the  Steeles Memorial Chapel in Toronto on Thursday.

<title>Sanders’ bigoted appointees endanger Clinton’s election</title>
<date>5/6/2016</date>
<content>
For many years now, support for Israel has been a rare point of bipartisan  consensus in an increasingly polarized political climate.Bernie Sanders  apparently seems determined to undermine that consensus.




Sanders has  demonstrated a consistent bias against the nation-state of the Jewish people and  surrounded himself with foreign-policy “experts” who often describe Israel as an  apartheid state, and have repeatedly accused the IDF of committing war crimes.  Sanders has clearly absorbed some of this rhetoric, as demonstrated in a series  of recent interviews, in which he grossly overstated the number of Palestinian  civilian deaths in Operation Protective Edge, and accused Israel of using  disproportionate force in response to Hamas’ rocket attacks.Following  these statements, primary voters in New York and across the Northeast decisively  rejected Sanders’ candidacy, and effectively ensured that Hillary Clinton will  be the next Democratic presidential nominee. But Sanders’ efforts to end the  Democratic Party’s support for Israel may well endanger Clinton’s prospects in  the general election.Rather than modify or moderate his positions on  Israel, Sanders now seems intent on remolding the Democratic Party to reflect  the views of his most radical anti-Israel (and anti-American) supporters.  Sanders apparently wants to use his newfound political clout to revise the  language of the Democratic Party platform as regards the only true democracy in  the Middle East.Sanders claims that he wants Democrats to embrace a more  “balanced approach” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but his appointment of  James Zogby and Cornel West to the Democratic Platform Committee suggests  anything but. Indeed, both Zogby and West are notorious for espousing policy  positions that are extremely critical of Israel, and for using rhetoric that  sometimes borders on anti-Semitic.Zogby, for example, has frequently  used provocative and even bigoted language when commentating on the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He has compared the plight of the Palestinian  people to that of the Jews during the Holocaust. He has described Gaza as “the  world’s largest concentration camp,” and has repeatedly accused the Israeli  government of perpetrating crimes against humanity. Comparing Israel’s self  defense actions to the Nazi genocide against the Jews is a not-so subtle form of  Holocaust denial: if all Nazi Germany did was defend itself against Jewish  aggression, then there were no gas chambers, no rounding up of Jews from the  most far-flung corners of Europe and transporting them to Auschwitz, and no  genocide.Moreover, Zogby has endorsed the Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions movement, which calls for the boycott only of Israeli goods and  institutions, until Israel allows for the so-called “right of return,” which  would turn Israel into yet another Arab-Muslim majority state. In effect Zogby  is supportive of a group whose stated objective is to undo over 30 years of  negotiations, and end the existence of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish  people.Zogby, however, seems like a moderate in comparison to West,  whose frequent diatribes against Israel at times speaks to a propensity for  borderline anti-Semitic stereotypes. According to West, for example, the Iraq  War was caused by “the close relationship between American imperial elites and  Israeli political officials.” He has repeatedly accused Israel of killing  Palestinian babies – an allegation that echoes historic attacks on Jews for  “blood libel” – and frequently claims that Israel is deliberately seeking to  annihilate the Palestinian people.Like many hard-left anti-Israel  bigots, West also has disdain for America and its current president, whom he has  accused of being a war criminal for supporting Israel’s military interventions  in Gaza, and for escalating the use of drones in operations against Islamic  State (ISIS) and al-Qaida.He has also called President Barack Obama “the  first niggerized president of the United States,” a remark which was widely  condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike. West justified his criticisms of  President Obama by explaining that the president “feels most comfortable with  upper middle- class white and Jewish men who consider themselves very smart,  very savvy, and very effective in getting what they want” thereby invoking  another anti-Semitic stereotype, that of the savvy Jewish  businessman.West has a long history of accusing Jews of being racist. He  claimed that “large numbers of Jews tried to secure a foothold in America by  falling in step with the widespread perpetuation of anti-black stereotypes and  garnering of white-skin privilege benefits to non-black Americans.”Yet it  is West who is doing the stereotyping: when West angrily left Harvard for  Princeton in 2002 because of a feud with Harvard’s then-president Larry Summers,  he said that Summers had “messed with the wrong Negro” and called Harvard’s  Jewish president “the Ariel Sharon of higher education.” West also called Black  Lives Matter a “marvelous new militancy...with courage, vision,” and  believes that the shooting of Michael Brown was a manifestation of “American  terrorism.” West also does not shy away from associating himself with 9/11  conspiracy theorists, going even himself so far as to suggest that one cannot be  certain whether Muslims were behind the attacks.Sanders’ decision to  elevate radicals like West and Zogby to positions of power within the Democratic  Party speaks to either a stunning lack of judgment or an underlying hostility  toward the nation-state of the Jewish people. Either way, it must be resisted by  the much-maligned Democratic Party establishment come the convention in  July.Hillary Clinton has already made significant concessions to the  so-called progressive wing of the party represented by Sanders. On issues like  free trade, the minimum wage and regulation of the financial industry she has  moved toward Sanders in meaningful ways. As far as Israel is concerned, however,  Clinton must stand her ground and oppose the fringe positions of the far-left.  If she does not, she may well suffer among centrist voters in several swing  states.Sanders seems determined to turn Israel into a partisan issue by  appointing surrogates like Zogby and West to rewrite the Democratic Party  platform.
It is up to centrist Democrats, who still represent a majority  of the party, to resist this attempt, and to ensure that support for Israel  remains a point of bipartisan consensus. Weakening this historic consensus would  be bad for Israel, for America, for peace – and for the electoral prospects of  the Democratic Party.

<title>Shimon Peres bucks BDS and wows audience in Johannesburg</title>
<date>1/3/2016</date>
<content>
JOHANNESBURG – “Arrest Peres,” was the strident cry of the Muslim Judicial  Association of South Africa, “when he steps off the plane on arrival in  Johannesburg.”The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement  called for “the urgent arrest of Peres who is meddling in our judicial  system.”




Shimon Peres was invited to Johannesburg, South Africa by the  Jewish community for the weekend starting February 26. The Israel United Appeal  and The United Communal Fund issued the invitation for Peres to come and address  the community.Locally, there were two concerns.He had just come  out of hospital after heart problems – would Peres, age 92, stand up to two long  plane flights within four days? Second, would his visit provoke protests and  demonstrations? As it turned out, both concerns were groundless. The event went  off without a hitch.The Sandton Convention Centre was full with 1,500  people seated one hour before starting time. There was a buzz of excitement and  expectation. They were entertained by African dancers and songs in the  vernacular and also Hebrew.Then Peres came in. Everyone stood, clapped  and cheered.This was followed by an excellent television account on two  massive screens of Peres’s life story.After that, the Israeli ambassador  to South Africa, Arthur Lenk, welcomed Peres to this country. Lenk commented  that Israel and Africa were neighbors and friends. In fact the president of  Kenya had just visited Israel. The ambassador asked Peres to come on stage,  where he was seated in a comfortable armchair, ready to be  interviewed.Peres opened by saying that the basis of Jewish life is  moral.“We were once the most lonely people in the world, but we still  paid attention to the poor, the stranger and those who were alone. We have  always been against slavery,” he said.When asked about the growing  isolation of Israel, Peres pointed out that on the contrary, Israel was now  cooperating with China on modern agricultural issues among others. “Similarly,  with India,” he said, “we are very friendly. Both have great populations.  Isolation?” Peres said that the new pope was a friend of Israel and was on  record as stating that the Jews were not responsible for the death of Jesus.  Peres then spoke about Nelson Mandela, the first president of “the free South  Africa.”“He was a very unique man.He spent many years in prison  but when he became president he set up The Truth and Reconciliation Commission  where people who had committed illegal acts could come and admit what they had  done and be able to apologize.This had never before been done in  history. Mandela put an end to the past. In each person there is a small  Mandela.”Asked about the BDS movement against Israel, Peres replied,  “There are gaps in their ignorance. Scholars who support this should go back to  school.”When asked about whether Israel was an “apartheid state” Peres  said, “Apartheid was established by law and there is no law like that in Israel.  Racism in Israel is a crime. You cannot be a Jew if you support  apartheid.”Asked about the current violence in Israel, Peres said that  it was the young people who were protesting. “But there are 11,000 Palestinian  children in our hospitals. Science and education could be the cure. The greatest  thing in life is to serve others. We were born to be friends.”Questioned  about Iran being the main threat to Israel, Peres said that the Iranians can  change their minds.“If there was a signed agreement, good things can  come out. Young people, especially women, want a better life; their children are  the victims now.”Concerning Islamic State, Peres said that wars don’t  bring victories, but only tombs. “Terrorism is more on the Arab side than on  ours.Killing their own people leads them nowhere. The future does not  belong to those who kill. They are in a land that is unconquerable. The future  does not belong to those who kill. Optimists and pessimists pass away the same  way, so don’t be a pessimist. Let us make the world better, starting with  technology. Israel started with nothing, but it had the greatest gift – human  resources. The wisest thing is to be honest and to invest in  friendship.”Peres ended with, “I want to say how much I appreciate being  here tonight,” and received prolonged applause.
After the meeting, a  black friend of mine, David Mabula, came up to me and said, “I saw a white  Mandela here tonight.”

<title>Shimon Peres in Johannesburg</title>
<date>29/2/2016</date>
<content>
JOHANNESBURG -- “Arrest Peres” was the strident cry of the Muslim Judicial  Association of South Africa “when he steps off the plane on arrival in  Johannesburg.” BDS called for “The urgent arrest of Peres who is meddling in our  judicial system.”Shimon Peres, the elder and revered Israeli former statesman, was  invited to Johannesburg by the Jewish Community for the weekend starting 26  February. The Israel United Appeal and The United Communal Fund issued the  invitation for Peres to come and address the Community.




Locally, there  were three concerns. He had just come out of hospital after heart problems; then  would Peres, aged 92, stand up to two long plane flights within four days?  Thirdly, would his visit provoke protests and demonstrations? As it turned out,  all three concerns were groundless.

The  greatest thing in life is to serve others.

<title>Simone Zimmerman: Pro-Israel enthusiast turned anti-Israel radical</title>
<date>27/4/2016</date>
<content>
Simone Zimmerman, Bernie Sander’s national Jewish outreach coordinator, created  quite a stir after her year-old profane rant against PM Netanyahu recently  became public. This led to her suspension from the campaign two days  later.Her family and friends are baffled how Zimmerman, who grew up in a  Zionist home, attended a Jewish day school (about 10 percent of her class serve  in the IDF), spent summers in Israel with her youth movement, and seemed  destined to become a stalwart of the pro-Israel community, became so virulently  anti-Israel.




Zimmerman arrived at UC Berkeley in fall 2009 as a  pro-Israel enthusiast, active with AIPAC, who felt her “duty going out into the  world is to defend Israel.” However, during her first year Zimmerman changed  dramatically.She became a J Street campus leader, and eventually  national president of J Street U.After graduating, she helped found, and  became a leader of, IfNotNow, a J Street offshoot that focuses on disrupting  Jewish organizations and aiming to “transform the Jewish community.”At  Berkeley, Zimmerman frequented Hillel, which presents itself as “home away from  home.” There, she encountered Kesher Enoshi, a Hillel group presenting programs  demonizing Israel and the IDF. Kesher Enoshi had been collaborating with  Students for Justice in Palestine, a leading BDS campus group – on the  Anti-Defamation League’s top 10 list of anti-Israel groups in America. The  Hillel director, Rabbi Naftalin-Kelman, supported and promoted Kesher  Enoshi.Reviewing a sampling of the toxic IDF/Israel- bashing programs  presented by Hillel and Kesher Enoshi illuminates the transformation Zimmerman,  and numerous other students, underwent.On September 16, 2009, Kesher  Enoshi, in conjunction with Students for Justice in Palestine, organized a  presentation by Shministim, Israeli draft-dodgers who defame the IDF and Israel.  The Shministim US tour was organized by the BDS group Jewish Voice for Peace,  also on the ADL top 10 list of anti-Israel groups in America. The Shmimistim  urged divesting from Israel.On October 7, 2009, Kesher Enoshi, along  with Students for Justice in Palestine, the Muslim Student Association, Jewish  Voice for Peace and other Israel BDS groups, sponsored a concert by a  Palestinian hip-hop artist.Some of the lyrics asserted that Israelis are  terrorists and equated Israel with Nazi Germany.On November 16, 2009,  Hillel’s Kesher Enoshi hosted the New Israel Fund-funded Breaking the Silence, a  fringe group that demonizes the IDF across the world, accusing it of human  rights abuses. Hillel’s publicity, sent to all the Jewish students, said:  “Through discussion we will expound about the idea of silence about human rights  abuses and connect the war in Iraq to events in Israel and  Palestine.”The event was also publicized and promoted by Students for  Justice in Palestine. Tom Pessah, Students for Justice in Palestine’s leader,  who headed the divestment campaign at Berkeley, and Rabbi Naftalin-Kelman, the  Hillel director, sat together at the event where students were divided into  small groups, each with a facilitator from Students for Justice in Palestine or  Hillel Kesher Enoshi leading the “discussion.”The fact that Jewish  students on campus are invited to Israel-bashing events by their Hillel (which  controls the list of the Jewish students on campus including the Taglit-  Birthright alumni) is highly significant. Hillel and its groups provide  legitimacy and credibility to the Israel-bashing events.Hillel’s Kesher  Enoshi’s slanderous events, organized with BDS groups, laid the groundwork for  the Berkeley Divestment Bill of 2010. The formerly pro-Israel Jewish students  played a key role in it. Hillel’s Kesher Enoshi students actively advocated for  the adoption of the anti-Israel divestment resolution before the Berkeley  Student Senate. This influenced several independent senators to support the  anti-Israel measure.The divestment bill, passed 16 to 4, was  subsequently vetoed by the Student Senate president. Although the veto was  sustained by a single vote, the divestiture coalition succeeded in defining the  terms of the debate while simultaneously advancing its narrative.This  snowballed into a BDS movement on campuses across North America delegitimizing  Israel.Even after the 2010 Divestment Bill at UC Berkeley, Hillel  continued collaborating with BDS groups. On February 11, 2011, Hillel hosted the  leaders of the Muslim Student Association – founded by the Muslim Brotherhood –  for Shabbat dinner. In its rally in Berkeley, MSA shouted: “From the River to  the Sea, Palestine will be Free.”On February 22, 2011, Hillel’s Kesher  Enoshi and J Street U brought the founder of the New Israel Fund-funded Sheikh  Jarrah Solidarity Movement to speak at Hillel. The Jewish Agency describes the  movement as “opposing the idea of Israel as a Jewish homeland and promoting an  anti-Zionist agenda.”The speaker, Assaf Sharon, demonized Israel,  describing Jerusalem as the symbol of evil.Pro-Israel students who  protested the Israel- demonizing event were told by the Hillel head that it was  within Hillel guidelines. It was not. Hillel guidelines forbid Israel-demonizing  events.Impressionable and susceptible Jewish students, such as  Zimmerman, have been systematically indoctrinated at Hillel with messages  dehumanizing Israel’s soldiers, portraying them as war criminals, and describing  Israel as an “occupying, apartheid state” committing “crimes against  humanity.”Many students from pro-Israel homes, even those with Israeli  parents, were coopted and alienated from Israel at Hillel. Many, like Eyal  Mazor, became BDS leaders. After graduating, Mazor joined two BDS groups: Code  Pink, which disrupted Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, and Jewish Voice for  Peace, with Mazor as a key organizer, which disrupted Netanyahu’s speech before  the General Assembly of Jewish Federations in New Orleans.Pro-Israel students, concerned parents and  community members protested to International Hillel leaders and the Berkeley  Hillel director regarding the dire situation. They never received a  reply.Rather than condone such madness and clean house, the Hillel  leadership and “leaders” such as Daniel Sokatch [now the president of the New  Israel Fund, former CEO of the SF Jewish Federation (which funded the Rachel  Corrie debacle, co-sponsored by BDS groups], covered up the situation at Hillel,  and enabled it to continue.After its exposure, Hillel’s Kesher Enoshi at  Berkeley morphed into J Street U. Simone Zimmerman became its leader and later  the J Street U national president. After graduating she helped found J Street’s  IfNotNow.The Berkeley Hillel director has been using his position and  resources to promote and advance J Street’s agenda. Despite the Jewish Student  Union at UC Berkeley’s democratic decision not to include J Street U, due to its  Israel-demonizing events, the Hillel leader blatantly disregarded the students’  will and vote, and brought J Street into Hillel.He has been funding it  and its activities and subsidized sending Hillel students to attend the National  J Street Conference in Washington.Simone Zimmerman and many other  students have been brainwashed and coopted.They are victims subjected to  a systematic and very effective indoctrination at the Campus Jewish Center  presenting itself as “Home away from home.”This is just the tip of the  iceberg. The dire situation is metastasizing across America. And the  consequences are grave.The writer, as a graduate student at UC Berkeley,  founded the Jewish Student Union and co-founded the Israel Action Committee  there. He also served as chairman of the Israeli Students Organization in North  America and was on the executive board of the North American Jewish Students  Network.
He is working on a film documenting the subversion of the  younger generation by J Street.

<title>SOUTH AFRICAN BUZZ: Mandela in Ramallah</title>
<date>27/4/2016</date>
<content>
The City of Johannesburg sponsored the erection of a six-meter bronze statue of  Nelson Mandela which was unveiled in newly named Mandela Square in Ramallah on  Tuesday.A delegation led by the mayor of Johannesburg, Parks Tau,  attended the unveiling ceremony. People living in the poorer districts of  Ramallah might well wonder why money could not have been diverted to them as  during the previous few days there have been protest marches there demanding  service deliveries which are constantly lacking.




Ramallah’s mayor, Musa  Hadid, said that the statue carried immense significance since Mandela was an  international symbol of peace to people striving for freedom and liberty.  Indeed, Mandela did speak broadly about various people’s liberation struggles,  but in fairness he never said anything detrimental about Israel. In fact, a  visit that he made to Israel in 1999, after he left office, was met with a great  deal of applause.Strangely, the whole story of the unveiling is being  treated with very low-key media interest here. Many newspapers do not mention it  at all, or else write about it hidden away in the inner pages. Only one national  TV news reported on it very casually well down its list.The Jewish  organizations here virtually ignored it but one member of the Zionist Federation  commented, off the record: “I hope that the Palestinians listen to what Mandela  had to say about peace and reconciliation and do as he did.”Women  singing Should women be allowed to sing when men are present? This has become a  rather contentious issue here because with Holocaust Remembrance Day approaching  the “pros” and “cons” on the issue have taken up their positions. Actually the  issue was brought to the fore when two Orthodox Jews (note Orthodox) opened  legal proceedings against the Cape Branch of the South African Jewish Board of  Deputies in the Equality Court to allow women to sing at the Holocaust  Remembrance Day ceremony. The board has responsibility for the  program.The board, for its part, says that it ensured that the ceremony  is as widely representative of all members of the community. “It has not been an  easy task,” it admits, “to balance the competing interests of the various  sections.” It has demonstrated its complete commitment to gender equality at  every level, including, it adds wistfully, “Women singing at other events under  its aegis.”The chairman of the Cape Council appealed, “Let us strive to  be unified as a community and deal with this issue and Yom Hashoah  respectfully.” He proposed a colloquium instead of going the court route, but  that could only be set up in two weeks, well after Holocaust Remembrance Day is  done and dusted for 2016.A Progressive woman rabbi from Johannesburg  associated herself with the initial legal challenge, for which she was suspended  by the SA Jewish Board in Johannesburg. Supporters of women singers point out  that the ban on women singing in the presence of men is not a Torah injunction  but a rabbinical decision and can therefore be reinterpreted according to later  scholars and students. What about Miriam singing, they ask? Now the latest news  is that judge Albie Sachs, a prominent anti-apartheid activist who lost an arm  in an assassination attempt and is well respected, has been asked to mediate.  Time is running out and it seems that possibly/probably at Holocaust Remembrance  Day ceremonies there will be two closures. The first, earlier, one to allow men  who don’t want to hear women sing, to leave. Then a later closure to incorporate  women singing.Oh vay! New pal in the Middle East Our beloved president  was on his travels again last week. This time he was in Iran in “a bid to  transform bilateral relations into a substantive strategic  partnership.”Zuma was given a royal reception with a military parade at  the airport and a motorcade plus decorated horsemen (the horses decorated, not  the riders) to the palace which once was that of shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He  was invited, apparently, by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, a rare  event.Zuma said, “We have expressed our congratulations to the people  and the government of Iran for the successful conclusion of the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action and the subsequent lifting of all nuclear-related  sanctions unilaterally imposed against the Islamic Republic.” Phew.Zuma  insisted that Iran had the right to develop nuclear energy for “peaceful  purposes.”He thanked Iran for the role it had played in securing a  nonracial South Africa.The South African delegation was over 100 strong,  many from banking and financial sectors. Their priority, they said, was  strengthening economic relations.The US has only lifted some of the  banking and financial sanctions – not released all frozen funds.Zuma,  ignoring his travails at home, praised Iran for its successful 1979 revolution  and several times cited Iran’s decision to follow the nuclear program  route.He and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani agreed to increase trade  relations to a billion dollars over four years. South Africa would boost oil and  gas imports and also build refineries.
They would also promote an  increase in bilateral tourism with the introduction of regular flights between  the two countries. Two days later and Zuma was back in South Africa. Promises,  promises.

<title>South African Buzz: Migrants and/or refugees</title>
<date>18/4/2016</date>
<content>
The unsettled states of Africa, with revolutions, coups, wars and invasions, led  to the rise of refugees and migrants seeking a safer, or at least a less  dangerous, environment. In the past few decades, South Sudan, the Democratic  Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Somalia are some of the countries  affected by war and uprisings. Countries to the south of the equator, Malawi,  Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe in particular, looked toward South Africa,  especially after the 1994 democratic elections there replaced the apartheid  government. In fact it is easier to name the countries in Africa that did not  have upheavals.Israel also had to face refugees crossing Sinai with the  aim of reaching Israel. Visit south Tel Aviv any night and have a  look.




Nowhere were these refugees really welcome – they were mostly poor,  badly educated, lacking skills and offering little in the way to the host  countries. When does a refugee become a migrant? That probably depends on the  definition given to them by a country that does not have the problem –  yet.After 2011 and the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya became the  stepping-off point for people fleeing unrest in North Africa and South Sudan.  They left for the island of Lampedusa off the southern coast of Italy.  (Incidentally creating a nice little earner for people in Libya with a craft or  boat capable of crossing the Mediterranean.) Italy could not stop the flow of  migrants, try as it did. The numbers were relentless. So too were the newsreels  and social media programs. The problem was unstoppable. Anyway it was Italy’s  problem, or so the rest or Europe averred.Then as the Arab Spring moved  eastwards especially to Syria and Iraq, the European Union knew that there was  no solution. Greece and its surrounding islands became the target points for  “entrepreneurs” to take people from Turkey in rickety, even dangerous  boats.The seemingly unstoppable problem led to the rise of right-wing  nationalism in Europe. Even traditional liberal countries like Denmark, Sweden  and The Netherlands looked on in horror as the rising tide of Islam arrived in  their lands.Now look at how South Africa dealt with a similar problem of  unwanted refugees – and there was no religious issue involved. In the local  patois, foreigners are referred to, rather unkindly, as “kwerekwere” and it  means whatever the speaker wants it to, but it is always said unkindly,  basically, “You are not welcome here...They come to take our jobs, at lower  wages, work in unskilled areas such as car guards, gardeners, night watchmen.  And so on. Also many from Zimbabwe have had army training and are said to make  up a large percentage of armed robbers and cash-in-transit heists as well as car  hijackings.”This is based on no tangible evidence but is accepted  anyway.In 2008 xenophobic riots broke out in Johannesburg, Durban and  Nelson Mandela Bay as Port Elizabeth is now called. These were occasions for  criminal behavior, killings ( over 100 dead), looting and assaults.To  their everlasting credit the South African Jewish Board of Deputies appealed to  the community to contribute to a fund that they set up to “help shopkeepers who  had lost everything.” In a statement they announced that scores on innocent  people were affected and needed help.What did not improve matters was  the pronouncement from the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, that “foreigners  should leave South Africa.” Just the other day a headline in the Johannesburg  newspaper read “Foreign Shops Ransacked. They came with hammers, rocks, they  took it all.”
And how is the European Union going to handle the  migrant/refugees situation? Not very promising, I’m afraid. The religious  differences certainly add a dangerous element. It has been said, unkindly, that  the arrival in Europe of scores of Muslims is a punishment to the Christians  living there for their treatment of the Jews over the years. Not nice!

<title>SOUTH AFRICAN BUZZ: Worst drought in South Africa since whenever</title>
<date>25/2/2016</date>
<content>
With the worst drought is South Africa within living memory or since 1929 or  since records were kept (take your choice), it has been estimated that over  two-and-a-half-million households are now short of basic food, obviously mostly  in the poorer (Black) areas.It was announced in Parliament that South  Africa would have to import over four million tons of maize/corn (maize is  called mielies in South Africa (a name that has just stuck), at a time when the  currency (the rand) is at a low level and is in danger of being downgraded  internationally to junk status.




The drought seriously affects five of the  11 provinces.Newspaper photographs of dead animals, domestic and wild,  lying on parched ground, bones exposed, are pitiable and harrowing. Because not  all the provinces are directly affected, government has hesitated to declare a  national disaster. Doing so would mean that funds kept as a “contingency  reserve” would have to be used. There is the argument (a rumor) put forward,  that, because of the country’s financial woes, the contingency reserve, like  Mother Hubbard’s cupboard, is bare. In fact a government minister is on record  as saying that this is not true. However, were these funds used to settle a  wages’ strike by trade unions, as another unsubstantiated rumor had it? With the  inevitable rise in food prices looming, drought and weak currency for imports,  South Africa is facing a winter of discontent. Food riots? Hmm.However,  in 2009 the University of Johannesburg signed a Scientific Research Agreement  with the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev to cooperate in microalgae  biotechnology, drip agriculture and water purification. Ben-Gurion’s then-vice  president for external affairs Prof. Amos Drory and the vice president of the  University of Johannesburg were the signatories. Bertie Lubner, of the  Ben-Gurion Board of governors and president of the South African Associates of  Ben-Gurion University, commented: “We are involved in extremely important  evolutionary research that will mainly benefit Third World  countries.”However...In 2011, the University of Johannesburg  called off the agreement. Nobel laureate and Archbishop Desmond Tutu supported  the break, citing Israel’s “apartheid.”Now to digress; in the book by  Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass, Alice berates Humpty Dumpty for  misusing a word. Humpty Dumpty replies, “When I use a word it means exactly what  I want it to mean, no more no less.” So when Tutu and others use the word  “apartheid,” it means exactly what they want it to mean, no more no less! The  University of Johannesburg announced that it was breaking the agreement because  of Israel’s “apartheid” (there we go again) and its “direct and indirect  military implications”! Ben-Gurion University announced that it regretted the  decision to end cooperation, “which would only hurt the residents of South  Africa, But Ben-Gurion University would continue its ongoing collaborative  researches with Palestinians in the field of water purification and healthcare  and other sustainable developments.”So back to 2016. A local conference  on water problems was canceled because the Israeli ambassador, Arthur Lenk, was  due to attend. The Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions crowd objected to his  presence. A letter to a local newspaper spelled it out: “Which is of greater  importance, the welfare of our water resources or a small group of bigots?  Israel has offered free help to South Africa, but Israel has to be shunned. Our  livestock will die, our crops will wither and we will suffer. But the BDS will  be triumphant.”In this matter, there will be losers. Who, I wonder?Death and life 

The largest English-language newspaper in Johannesburg is The  Star. Turn to its classified pages and the death notices and Magen Davids stand  out prominently together with the births and marriages (hatches, matches and  dispatches as they are called).The death notices immediately give an  indication of the state of Johannesburg and indeed, of South African  Jewry.A look at a few, taken at random: “(Name) 1930- 2016 passed away  in Canada. Wake to be held in Johannesburg at (address).” Another: “(Name)  passed away in Los Angeles. Mourned by his brother (name) in Johannesburg.”  Another: “Devastated by the passing of our sister (name) and all our family in  USA and Australia.” Another: “It is with great sorrow that we announce the  passing of (name) in Australia.A memorial service will be held at the  Great Park Synagogue in Johannesburg.” Another: “A very special Safta  [grandmother] passed away in Israel, mourned by the family in Johannesburg, by  (name) in Boston, and (name) in Melbourne.” Another: “(Name) an adored husband  of (name) and dad of (three names) passed away in St. Louis, USA.” Another:  “(Name) passed away in Johannesburg, mourned by (name) family in Sydney, (name)  in Toronto, (name) in Chicago and (name) in Netanya.”This, sadly, shows  the break-up and scattering of Jewish family life in South Africa. So many  elderly couples have children and grandchildren spread over five continents. In  1970s the Jewish population in South Africa was halved by emigration.How  many elderly Jews pass away in retirement homes or old-age homes with no family  near? These homes are cynically called “Departure Lounges.” That is the accepted  life of South African Jews today.Statistic: There are about 45,000 Jews  in Johannesburg.
Recently it was announced that the West Park Jewish  Cemetery in Johannesburg had buried its 15,000th Jewish person.

<title>South African buzz: Zuma – The wrecking ball?</title>
<date>24/3/2016</date>
<content>
Hark! Listen! They sound you hear is either tinnitus  or South Africa imploding. R.W.Johnson, a British author living in South  Africa, recently published a book, How Long Will South Africa Survive?: The  Looming Crisis. He is pessimistic about the future. However, Israel’s former  president Shimon Peres said that pessimists end up in the grave. He is an  optimist who “invests in the future.”




Indeed, South Africa has troubles  with President Jacob Zuma. It is unbelievable what a bad press he gets here.  There are problems with the currency, the rand. Moody’s Investors Service is in  the country and the fear is that it will downgrade our credit to junk status  with all the tsorris that come with that. In addition the railways are in  difficulties, the post office is bankrupt, there is turbulence in South African  Airways, in the electricity supply corporation. There are problems with the gold  and platinum mines, with the universities, with primary education, with service  delivery in many mostly poorer areas etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. I could go on  and on.But this last week has been bewildering. A family from India –  the Guptas – who are closely connected with the Zuma family have been said to  have “captured South Africa.” That is, to have bought their way into the highest  levels.Now it has emerged that the Guptas even offered cabinet positions  to various people obviously for private reasons. Apparently they had sufficient  influence on Zuma to persuade him to appoint their chosen. Now suddenly we have  heard from people who have refused the Guptas. The cat is out of the bag! The  Guptas really became known here when they landed a private jet passenger plane  at a military airport near Pretoria. It brought Gupta friends to a family  wedding. Private plane? Military airport? Some poor airport official was blamed  eventually.So now we have Zumagate, Guptagate and Investigate, although  it is unlikely that an investigation into the third one will ever be opened, and  the same goes for the other two! Dore Gold in the land of gold In the midst of  Israel Apartheid Week here, Ambassador Dore Gold of the Israel Foreign Ministry  arrived, almost unnoticed and barely reported.Apparently and  surprisingly, he had been invited by the director-general of the Department of  International Relations and Cooperation.Gold wanted “normalization of  relations as part of Israel’s policy to foster stronger relations in  Africa.”A writer to a newspaper stated, “It makes perfect sense to learn  from them. Israel is leader in technology and medicine. In problems we face in  agriculture, water, sanitation, electricity and on many other levels South  Africa can only benefit from cooperation with Israel.”But a spokesman  from the Department of International Relations said, “We have diplomatic  relations with Israel but that doesn’t mean we won’t support  Palestine.”Gold visited places relating to the anti-apartheid struggle,  including the Mandela House museum and sites in Soweto where the struggle was  fierce.He also met the chief rabbi of South Africa, Warren  Goldstein.Gold was born in America in 1953, came to Israel and in time  served as Israel’s permanent representative at the United Nations from 1997 to  1999.The question is: Can he change Israel’s diplomatic approaches to  countries where Israel is not exactly embraced? He has Netanyahu’s authority  behind him in the Foreign Ministry, which will lend a new punch in diplomatic  efforts.An interesting note: Dore gold bar is a pure alloy of gold and  silver. Can Dore bring some gold to Israel’s relations with South Africa? Israel  Apartheid Week We need to remind ourselves of the 2001 UN Conference on Racism  held in Durban which branded Israel an “apartheid state.” This was the birth of  BDS. Its aim was to end the occupation, bring back the refugees of 1948 and  delegitimize Israel.One must also recall the disrupted piano recital of  2013 by Israeli pianist, Yossi Reshef at the University of Witwatersrand in  Johannesburg. The concert had hardly begun when it was disrupted by BDS members  abusing the pianist, the organizers and the audience with shouts of “Kill the  Jews.”The BDS regarded this as a triumph.Now it was that time of  the year for BDS and its fellow travelers to raise their annual Israel Apartheid  Week. The focus of BDS is to present Israel as “a uniquely evil and illegitimate  Zionist entity” living on stolen Palestinian land. They are obsessed with the  word “apartheid” despite little experience of it.On the campus of the  University of Witwatersrand, the BDS supporters lined up on one side of a field,  with the SA Union of Jewish Students on the other side. The verbally abused each  other with threats and insults. SAUJS used a subtle poster campaign with large  photos of Nelson Mandela with favorable comments about Israel and Jewish people.  Also a poster on “The United Colours of Israel” showing how mixed and diverse  the community is particularly stressing color. There was a poster on democracy  showing Arab women voting, something unknown in some Muslim countries.In  addition there were Jewish marches, one in Cape Town on Parliament and another  in Johannesburg on the Legislature Building. This march was also supported by a  group called the South African Friends of Israel, fiercely pro-Israel. A member  said, “Most, if not all, BDS supporters have never visited Israel or have much  knowledge of the situation in the Middle East. Theirs is a completely emotional  reaction. Where ignorance is bliss.”
So the Israel Apartheid Week turned  out to be a dismal debacle. Now to oppose it the Jews here are establishing  their own IAW – Israel Awareness Week.

<title>Stop using apartheid for your own agenda</title>
<date>21/2/2016</date>
<content>
There is a difference between somebody who is exposed and someone who is  informed. I recently took part in an educational tour to Israel and Palestine.  This was a remarkable exposure trip, co-ordinated by South African Israel  Forum.I am now in a good space to distinguish between the Israeli and  Palestinian narratives and I realize that the aim was not to make me (and fellow  young leaders) pro-Israel, but rather for us to be more exposed to a narrative  that is not often heard in South Africa.




Like many other colonized  countries, Israel was liberated in 1948 from the British system. However, from  the year of liberation onwards, there have been severe conflicts between Israel  and its neighboring countries, and in later years, between Israel and the  Palestinian Authority. I was surprised to find that Israel has made peace with  most of its former adversaries; however, the Israeli-Palestinian peace  negotiations have proven to be very challenging and complex for both  parties.A fascinating feature of the country is its patriotism, seen  with the presence of the Israeli flag in every part of the country, even in Tel  Aviv (the financial capital and economic hub of the country).The Israeli  sense of patriotism and cultural desire to better its society, no matter the  race, gender, religion or political affiliation of its citizens became very  evident to us, wherever we went. I went to Israel expecting to witness an  apartheid state, but I immediately understood that I had been  misled.During my trip, something became very clear to me: the current  conflict is more religious than political. Lack of knowledge yields obtuse  decisions and thinking, but I am truly inspired to have explored institutions of  higher learning in Israel, wherein lie the element of peace and hope for the  country’s stability.I have noted that these Israeli universities are  products of diversity and unity, yielding an environment full of tolerance.  Institutions of higher learning, and students in general, are in search of, and  are partaking in, a common fight for a peaceful solution.Another  observation I made during the trip was the vast difference between Israeli and  Palestinian cities. In Israeli communities and kibbutzim, people embrace  respect, social norms and communal values, largely promoting peace and  coexistence.However, in Palestinian cities and the Kalandia refugee  camp, in Ramallah, controlled by the Palestinian Authority, the modus operandi  is completely different. Many people there do not practice what they preach in  the media. They believe that the radical political influence of Hamas violence  toward Israeli Jews is the defining factor for their liberation, according to  their own right. As they openly expressed to us, they believe that the country  should have Palestinians as first-class citizens and Israelis as second-class  citizens. Moreover, I can say that there will never be two bulls in one kraal,  hence, a two-state co-existence seems almost impossible for both countries, at  this point in time.I am not a Christian, nor am I religiously  affiliated, but I am inspired by Christians, particularly the Bible Church that  seeks to promote the difference and importance of culture, tradition, politics;  using the Bible as the navigator to peace. Clearly, even if like myself you are  not a believer, you can be open-minded enough to learn that stability within the  region requires more than just religious intervention.I was inspired by  the Palestinian Christian population in their approach toward peace with  Israelis and their willingness, unlike Muslim nationalists, to lay down arms and  denounce violence against others.In summary, “variety is the spice of  life,” thus I believe that people should not rely on what is portrayed and  projected by the media, because, when it comes to Israel, it presents one-sided  information and propaganda. I recommend that other South Africans take the time  and make the effort to ensure that they visit Israel and Palestine, or at least  make the effort to investigate both sides, before making decisions about  Israel.I decided to write this article because I, personally, will no  longer allow other people to use our tragedy, as the survivors of apartheid, for  their own agenda.Knowledge is power and instead of being a victim of  misinformation, I intend to be an ambassador of peace in this very complex and  difficult conflict.Your sense of solidarity should be informed. And the  problems between Israel and Palestine should never be compared to South African  Apartheid; the current conflict is completely different: it is not a racial  conflict and from my perspective, it is far more religious than it is  political.

<title>Telling Israel’s story</title>
<date>4/9/2016</date>
<content>
The new academic year is nearly upon us and students returning to campus can  expect to encounter a particularly acerbic anti-Israel climate following a  summer marked by social unrest in America and terrorist attacks in  Europe.College campuses are the epicenter of socially conscious young  adults seeking to champion justice and equal rights. The boycott, divestment and  sanctions (BDS) movement has exploited these passions by employing  “intersectionality”; forging partnerships with oppressed groups seeking social  justice. Case in point, earlier this month more than 60 groups associated with  the Black Lives Matter movement released a platform that labels Israel an  “apartheid state” and alleges it perpetrates a “genocide” against the  Palestinians.




While BDS has fashioned itself into the du jour political  movement, the great irony is that its activists have fixated on the only country  in the Middle East with a justice system that guarantees equality for every  citizen regardless of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.Many  of the movement’s supporters are not familiar with the BDS founders’ goals and  financiers. If they were, perhaps they would be less inclined to champion a  movement that impedes peace and is celebrated by the likes of Hamas and the  Muslim Brotherhood.The upcoming school year will be further challenged  by the impending 50-year anniversary of the Six Day War. Two divergent movements  will undoubtedly emerge – one will celebrate half a century of a reunified  Jerusalem and a second, more vocal group will spend the year denouncing half a  century of Israeli “occupation.”There are two competing narratives on  campus and day by day, Israel’s champions are losing ground. The progressives  accuse Israel of stifling equality, denying human rights and eroding democracy.  The tragedy of these accusations is that nothing could be further from the  truth. Visit Haifa’s Technion or the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and you will  see equality in the Jewish, Christian and Muslim students who study  side-by-side.March alongside the thousands of revelers in Tel Aviv’s  annual Pride Parade and you will see firsthand that Israel champions human  rights. Visit the Knesset and you will find a cross section of society  demonstrating the vibrancy of Israel’s open democracy.We have every  reason to be proud of Israel, but we have allowed our critics to define Israel  through the lens of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A strategy built on  reaction, defense and refutation will never prove effective. As former Israeli  ambassador to Washington and Israeli public diplomacy chief Michael Oren  recently wrote, “We tell people to defend Israel without actually telling them  what they should be defending.”We can’t win hearts and minds by  contesting every allegation and accusation. We must pick our battles carefully  and refute the most damaging assertions, but our focus should be on broadening  the conversation and creating meaningful, individual connections to  Israel.Israel’s detractors know how to tell and sell a compelling story.  We in turn have relied on facts and figures, hoping that reason alone will  prevail. Reading the encyclopedia will never rival a compelling story or a  montage of poignant images.We often forget that we too have a story – a  story of hope, courage and freedom. Ours is the story of a people who were  exiled from their home and scattered across the globe. For 2,000 years we were  subject to persecution, pogroms and, ultimately, the Holocaust.The  Jewish people endured the worst of humanity, but we never lost our humanity. We  refused to succumb to hatred and despair, remaining steadfast in our desire to  build a nation that embodies our Jewish and democratic values. Fueled by faith  and determination, we returned to our homeland and built a state with freedoms,  stability and opportunities that are the envy of the Middle East.Israel  is an inspiration to the champions of human hope and human dignity. The state’s  spirit of dynamism, innovation, culture and creativity are simply unmatched.  Israel is capitalizing on that spirit and forging new partnerships in Asia and  Africa and building historic alliances with nations from the Arab and Gulf  community.Sixty years before Israel’s birth, a Jewish poet named  Naphtali Herz Imber wrote a poem entitled “Tikvatenu,” which means “Our Hope.”  Conceived during a period of profound despair and danger for the Jews of Europe,  it inspired a generation to will an impossible dream to life.When that  dream became a reality, Imber’s poem became Israel’s national anthem. Today, we  have a strong and vibrant homeland and we must continue to be inspired by the  values and hope that sustained us for millennia. The onus is on us to tell our  remarkable story in our own voice.Joe Hyams is CEO of  HonestReporting.com, a non-profit organization dedicated to fair and accurate  media coverage for Israel.Aviva Klompas is the senior director of Israel  advocacy at Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston.

<title>Telling it like it is: A new method of campus Israel advocacy</title>
<date>5/3/2016</date>
<content>
To describe the battle for Israel on campus as an increasingly difficult task  would be an understatement. We spent nearly three years advocating for Israel on  campuses across the UK – and we understand how difficult it can be for an  undergraduate student to freely profess pro-Israel views. We were personally  subjected to lengthy abuse over the years – we withstood the threatening  spectacles and the annual hysteria of Israel Apartheid Week. We had our talks  shut down by skeptical union authorities – or if we managed to host them, they  were disrupted by those who seemingly dedicate their professional lives to  pro-Palestinian activism.Yet in spite of all our experiences, we were  astounded by the news in January that a talk delivered by Ami Ayalon – the  former head of the Shin Bet (Israeli Security Agency) – was physically attacked  by a mob of violent extremists pounding the windows of a lecture hall at King’s  College London. The scenes have been described plenty of times across the  national media – but what struck us was the libelous allegations which fueled  such physical violence. Ayalon was allegedly a “war criminal” – and war  criminals were understandably not welcome at King’s College London (a  declaration which, incidentally, has been made plenty of times before regarding  visiting Israelis).




It is of course important to protect the freedom of  speech of any individual, no matter how repugnant or vile their views may be –  yet naturally, it is incredibly difficult to defend the speech of a man whom so  many would slanderously compare to a Milosevic or an Assad. We reckoned that  taking the higher ground in student discourse would not merely entail a defense  of the liberal values which form the heart of a university – after all, it is  doubtful that any college would approve of an actual war criminal speaking on  campus.Instead, we were reminded of the principle which is too often  ignored by those who lead the charge in presenting Israel’s case: the idea that  it is supremely important to directly challenge the slanders and libels which  nearly dominate the perception of Israel held by so many students.We  decided to act, and we created the Pinsker Centre for Zionist Education – a  coalition of young people and students who seek to organize events on campus  which will emphatically address the most sensitive topics of discussion  surrounding the Arab-Israeli conflict.Predictably, we launched with an  event featuring the famed Colonel Richard Kemp, addressing what he termed “the  libelous myths of Israeli war crimes.” The former commander of British forces in  Afghanistan astonished an audience of over 180 people at University College  London – who rewarded him with a standing ovation for demolishing the “body  count morality” which determines Israeli “disproportionality” in military  conflict.By bringing in one of Britain’s leading experts to speak on  this topic, during Israeli Apartheid Week, we arguably made an important  statement.Even for those who left Col.Kemp’s talk in  disagreement, there was an appreciation of the rare space for open discussion we  had provided.Handing out falafel balls and dancing to Mizrahi music in a  baroque quadrangle is great fun – and it arguably shows a bright side to the  modern culture of the Israeli state. But one has to recognize that such a method  of campaigning in no way directly addresses the dangerous misperceptions which  so many students hold. If someone believes Israel is a settler-colonial state  which committed a bevy of serious war crimes in 2014, a glossy leaflet waxing  lyrical on the miracles of Israeli technology is not going to be of much use. On  the other side of the coin, handing out leaflets in support of the “two states  for two peoples” paradigm is admirable – but how do these leaflets actually  promote any concrete steps to materialize such a solution? On that note, it’s  about time young people begin to act in an area where they can actually make a  difference: the tone and character of academic discourse in Western  universities.Instead of shying away from the issues which might  irreparably damage the case for Israel in the near future, we need to tackle  them headon.Students shouldn’t be shy of debating whether Zionism is  racism or whether Israeli state structures resemble apartheid.The only  way to successfully present the case for Israel on campus is to replicate this  recent success. In an increasingly censorious student culture, we need to create  an open space for lively discussions with no holds barred. We need to invite  Britain’s most eloquent defenders of the Israeli state to face any point of  discussion – however critical or inaccurate – and open our minds to all sorts of  arguments.Instead of self-censorship or bowing to intimidation, we need  to work with university authorities to demolish the censorious silliness of  intellectual “safe spaces” while providing a genuine safe space – one free from  physical violence. But most importantly, we need to end the simplistic  presentation of a paradisaical Israel which avoids most discussion with the  country’s detractors.It’s not all doom and gloom for pro-Israel  activism. We have immense resources and human capital at our disposal – and in  time, we can surely shape the intellectual character of the discourse  surrounding our cause.

<title>TERRA INCOGNITA: Israel’s dangerous anti-strategic game</title>
<date>7/2/2016</date>
<content>
Have you heard the story about how Palestinians reject peace? Have you heard  about how Palestinians incite against Israel? Reject Israel’s right to exist?  Did you hear about how the boycott movement opposes any form of Jewish state?  That Israel is a victim of an unfair media, disproportionate criticism by the  international community and bias among college students? Have you heard that  even Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, French Foreign  Minister Laurent Fabius and US Secretary of State John Kerry all present  unrealistic peace goals and subject Israel to criticism while not holding  Palestinians to the same standards or other countries to the same standards?  Most everyone familiar with Israel has heard elements of these stories. Some of  them are the classic pro-Israel talking points. What most everyone who hears  them and has some sympathy for the Israeli position never seems to ask is, “So  what?” 




For instance during a debate at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee on February 1, MKs railed against the “imbalanced theater” the foreign  media subjects Israel to. MK Michael Oren noted that many cases during the  Israel-Palestinian conflict events were “staged and orchestrated” and the media  bought the Palestinian narrative.So what? If events are routinely  orchestrated, if Israel is subjected to one-sided narratives, then that is a  known quantity that should be addressed, rather than just complained about. What  to do about it? If you go into a situation, say a soccer game, always being down  five points, but that’s the situation in game after game, don’t you prepare your  players to fight that game based on it being rigged? If every hand of poker your  opponents got to see half of your cards, you’d have to adjust play accordingly  or just not play. Yet Israel often seeks to play the same game, with basically  the same tactics, and ends up with the same results.The central problem  for Israel and its strategic long-term goals is that even if every pro-Israel  argument is correct, it doesn’t change the ultimate issues facing Israel. Let’s  consider a few examples.

Palestinian incitement against Israel One of the  strongest Israeli claims regarding the reason there is no peace and never can be  peace is that large numbers of Palestinians “reject peace” and “hate Israel.”  For instance a December poll by the Palestine Center for Policy and Study  Research showed that 66 percent of Palestinians supported stabbing attacks  against Israelis. The level of support for attacks on Israeli civilians changes  over the years, as illustrated by Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki’s work,  but the general incitement, the TV programs, the speeches, the sermons, the  portrayal of every attacker as a martyr, doesn’t change greatly.The  existence of widespread incitement is a fact.There may be excuses for  it, explanations for it, but it’s existence is a fact. It will not change. If  the fact that large numbers of Palestinians support harming Israeli civilians as  a form of resistance is the “reason” there cannot be a change in the “peace  process,” then that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. There will always be  incitement, therefore Israel can never leave the West Bank or change its methods  of rule, because it has to control Palestinians because they incite. That’s not  a strategy, that’s allowing the views of the other to dictate your  policy.

Palestinians reject peace There is ample evidence, just by  looking at political posters and educational materials in the Palestinian areas,  that most Palestinians reject the existence of the State of Israel and see any  sort of agreement as merely a stage on the way to the eventual disintegration of  Israel.Whether it is the large-scale and constant discussion of the  “right of return” or just maps that never depict Israel, it’s clear that this is  the case.Israel’s strange reaction to the concept that its enemies  “reject peace” is to therefore give them what they want; no change in policy.  Israel surrenders its own strategic choices by putting the ball in the  Palestinian court and saying “until you accept peace, you can have the ball.”  Israel’s strategy is thus made in Ramallah or the Gaza Strip. “They reject  peace” therefore means there cannot be change.

Time is on whose side? The  Israelis and Palestinians both believe time is on their side. If they didn’t  then one of the two groups would have sought out a radical change in the  conflict. The Israeli government that sought to inaugurate the Oslo peace  process was convinced that extricating Israel from the West Bank and Gaza was in  Israel’s long-term interest. Since that time the Israeli government has  abandoned that strategic plan in favor of tinkering with the interim aspects of  Oslo, namely the manifestation of the Palestinian Authority, with no horizon in  sight for either Oslo or the PA.Consider the long-term element of the  stages in this “peace” process. For almost 20 years Israel existed within the  1949 borders, the Green Line. From 1967 to 1987, Israel ran the lives of  millions of Palestinians with minimal levels of conflict. That’s a second  20-year period. After several years Israel and the Palestinians set in motion  the Oslo process. For 20 years that structure has been in place, basically  1995-2015.What is the next 20-year period? If time is not on Israel’s  side, what shall Israel do? The long-term strategy of Palestinians is the  creation of a Palestinian state. Are they further from that goal in 2016 than in  1948? The opposition to the concept of two states that now unites everyone from  the extreme Right in Israel to most of the center-left means that this entire  political bloc believes time is on Israel’s side.Palestinians, in  various forms of political leadership, think the same thing. “Existing is  resisting,” they say, or samud, “steadfastness” in the face of Israel. There  isn’t mass migration from the West Bank or Gaza. Israelis say “it’s not fair”  that Palestinians are permanent refugees, or invent pipe dreams like “Jordan is  Palestine.”But quite obviously Palestinians don’t accept this, and they  believe the longer things go on, the more Israel will fade away like the  Crusader states of old.If two sides are playing this game and both sides  think time is on their side, one of them must be wrong. Two people playing  chess, who think that overall their strategy will work, cannot both be  correct.

Who has more to lose? Let’s say the chances that Israel is wrong  in its analysis that time is on its side is 50-50. Israel and Palestine are not  equals; Israel has far more to lose if its current strategy is wrong. If the  Palestinians are wrong, and time is not on their side, then the worst that can  happen to them has already happened. In Gaza they live in a blockaded enclave of  a million people, lacking basically any rights and living in abject poverty,  sometimes inundated by sewage or flooding.How could that get worse? In  the West Bank they live in a semi-autonomous series of mini-cantons, with  circuitous roads and bad infrastructure linking them.They have  sub-standard education and rely often on Israel for basic things such as water,  electricity or emergency medical care. What can get worse? Can they be deprived  of more rights? Can more of them be taken away for administrative detention? Not  that much.But Israel, as a functioning, high-tech, infrastructure- rich  first world country can get much worse. Israel is on the cusp of becoming a  truly first world country.It functions better than many countries in  Eastern Europe and is around 35th in the world in terms of GDP per capita. The  West Bank and Gaza are ranked between 128th and 140th. Palestine can’t get much  poorer, but Israel certainly can. Israel basically has nowhere to go but down.  Just take a look at the countries above Israel in GDP per capita and ask which  ones will be declining. Which ones are fighting an intractable conflict? Which  ones have massive housing problems and social balkanization? 

Beware the  demographic logic trap A demographic debate about Israel’s need to leave the  West Bank assumes the apartheid allegation against Israel is correct and that  minor tinkering with borders will preserve the “Jewish” part of the Jewish  state. It’s a grim anti-strategic analysis that places the country’s future in  the wombs of its residents. The more secular Jewish public demands less  Palestinians, whereas the more right wing religious public wants to control more  Palestinians as long as they don’t vote.The center wants it both ways,  no annexation and no Palestinian state. Allowing demographics to dictate policy  means that eventually a convincing argument in Israel can be made for  withdrawing from other parts of the country, as long as there are too many  “others” in them. Withdrawing at the last minute due to a brutal  apartheid-numbers analysis, seems like the last choice of a policy-making  machine that has ground to a halt. As Gaza shows, the mere aspect of withdrawal  is only part of the battle, Israel still controls Gaza for the most part and  provides it with various resources.The belief among some Israelis that  there are less Palestinians than statistics show, doesn’t change the overall  issue relating to constant cycles of violence, the need for a large standing  army that operates as a riot police force and denial of basic civil rights to  the Palestinian population. As has been illustrated in Jerusalem, even when  there is annexation, there is little change in the level of hostility and  relations between the Israeli governing officials and the Palestinian  residents.

So what? Israel has a difficult strategic problem. In the long  term its support in Europe is eroding. Its support in America is likely to erode  as a new generation takes the reins of the Democratic Party. It has new allies  in Asia and the disintegration of the Middle East is both a benefit and a  threat. It is so entangled in the West Bank its ability to withdraw is in  doubt.The worst thing for Israel is the constant abdication of  responsibility by its political elites. “They hate us” is not an answer to a  strategic goal. Israel chose to conquer the West Bank. It chose to export a half  million citizens into the West Bank. It chose to annex east Jerusalem. In all  these choices the local Palestinians were not asked their say in the matter. All  of the choices are Israel’s. Yet the rules of the game are such that the media  and international community are biased against Israel or hold it to a higher  standard.Israel abdicates responsibility by deciding that despite  knowing the rules of the game, it will continue to play by the Palestinian  timetable, waiting for peace and love to breakout, managing the conflict and  complaining that the rules won’t change.
Someone needs to remind Israelis  and their supporters: The rules are never going to change. The international  community and media will continue to be biased against the country. Most  Palestinians will never change their overall views of Israel. Brand Israel will  continue to be toxic in the West. You have more to lose, and time is probably  not on your side. There is dire need for a long-term strategy to address that.  It’s time to ask the right questions, rather than just feign  irresponsibility.

<title>Comment: ‘Everyone I hate is Hitler’- Dangerous politicization of antisemitism</title>
<date>20/11/2016</date>
<content>
AUS administration run by the “alt-right neo-Nazi movement,” claims a  commentator online. The chief strategist is an American Goebbels. One meme  reads: “First they came for the Muslims and we said ‘not this time mother –’”  signed by someone named April Daniels. A cartoon by Eli Valley shows Pepe the  frog (a symbol of the far Right) speaking with Sheldon Adelson, saying, “So it’s  agreed we exterminate the Jews here and you can exterminate the Palestinian  there.” To which the Adelson character says, “Sign me up.” Liana Fincke drew a  cartoon showing a devil wearing a swastika saying “vote for me I’m pro-Israel”  and another man saying “duh... okay.” A journalist posted a “template for how to  respond” if approached by Trump with a letter from 1962 from Bertrand Russell to  British fascist Oswald Mosley.“Trump has shattered Jews’ American  idyll,” claimed Chemi Shalev. “American Jews have transformed virtually  overnight from insiders to outsiders. If worse comes to worst, they’ll always  have Israel.”




The Anti-Defamation League’s national director claimed that  the US “has not seen this level of antisemitism in mainstream political and  public discourse since the 1930s.” One more piece of evidence.The  Associated Press tells us “American Jews alarmed by surge in  antisemitism.”But the actual statistics on hate crimes are more  vague.An NYPD report on November 6 showed there were 103 antisemitic  incidents so far in 2016 compared to 125 for all of 2015 – so basically no  change. According to the FBI there were 664 anti-Jewish incidents in 2015 (there  were 257 against Muslims and 1,700 against African-Americans). That’s an increase from 609  in 2014. Back in 1996 there were 1,109.An ADL blog claimed a “rash of  vandalism and swastikas reported following election day.” The same ADL asserted  that “antisemitic assaults rise dramatically across the country in 2015.” Actual  numbers showed a 3% increase from 2014; 941 incidents versus 912. Rather than a  dramatic rise, New York showed a decrease in incidents, from 231 to 198. But  “antisemitism decreases” is not a headline. “Worst antisemitism since 1930s”  is.There is no doubt people are alarmed in America. An article in  Fortune noted that over 800 journalists had reported antisemitism on Twitter  related to this election.Part of the reason people are alarmed is  because of the hundreds, probably thousands of articles about the “surge” and  “spike” in antisemitism since the US election – none of which actually showed  any data about the supposed increase and most of which relied on data from  before the election or from 2015 (one report claimed “US hate crimes against  Muslims surge 67 percent,” but the data all related to a surge in 2015, not  2016). “Trump’s election triggers old nightmares for Holocaust survivors in  America,” wrote Marisa Fox-Bevilacqua at Haaretz. They’ve been triggered because  of a wave of hysteria and psychosis that has pushed fearmongering to  extraordinary levels. Probably never in history have so many people written so  much about so little antisemitism.How did we get here? For years those  crying “antisemitism” tended to be associated with pro-Israel Jewish  voices.Ruth Wisse at Tablet wrote in May 2015 that “antisemitism on  American college campuses is rising and worsening.”She quoted a Louis D.  Brandeis Center survey showing “more than half of Jewish American college  students personally experienced or witnessed antisemitism.” However almost all  the examples in the article related to anti-Israel events. “Every year, some 200  campuses now host a multiday hate-Jews fest, its malignancy encapsulated in its  title: ‘Israel Apartheid Week.’” Antisemitism was “spiking” and “skyrocketing”  on campus, newspapers told us. The Observer claimed one report showed 287  antisemitic incidents by June 2016 compared to 198 in 2015. “Campus events  denying the right of Israel to exist – which nearly tripled,” was a major  component.There were also other incidents of non-Israel related  antisemitism such as Oberlin College’s former assistant- professor Joy Karega  posting on social media stories claiming the Rothschilds control the world. As  recently as November 2 the Zionist Organization of America was speaking out  about antisemitism on campus.In a sense it was the Jewish Right that  dominated and owned the “antisemitism rising” brand. In the 1980s the extremist  rabbi Meir Kahane even used to talk about a “second Holocaust” in America. But  the election in 2016 changed all that. Suddenly people on the Left began to  worry that what they called “alt-right white supremacy” was connected to the  Donald Trump campaign. In September The Daily Beast published “Alt-Right  leaders: We aren’t racist, we just hate Jews.” Combined with the antisemitic  attacks on journalist Julia Ioffe in April after her profile of Melania Trump,  the Left began to take back the “antisemitism is a threat” story.Piecing  together a few quotes from articles at Breitbart, one of which was written by  David Horowitz (who is Jewish), many writers connected the dots to dangerous  antisemitism circulating around the campaign. When Trump won the election Samuel  Freedman called it the “revenge of white supremacy” and Bradley Burston claimed  it was a “historic victory for antisemitism.” The target of these writers was  often Stephen Bannon and his association with Breitbart. “What’s more, unlike  Trump, Bannon does not appear to be merely manipulating these people for  political gain. He really hates us,” wrote Eric Alterman. There was actually  scant evidence of Bannon’s antisemitism, as Alan Dershowitz has pointed out, but  if you tell a story long enough it appears to be true.So what is really  going on? Many voices on the Left have used antisemitism as a tool against the  Trump administration, exaggerating the levels of antisemitism and the extent of  it. They disregard evidence that Trump grew up around Jews and indeed that his  family is intermarried with Jews, and they disregard that Bannon even created an  Israeli-run version of his website. Unfortunately, just as the Right exaggerated  rising campus antisemitism, misinterpreting every anti-Israel act as pernicious  (accusing Jewish groups who are anti-Zionist of being antisemitic), the Left  exaggerates every hint of racism on the right as antisemitic, when in reality  much of the racism is directed at other communities. Of course the racism is  vile, but it should be confronted as racism, not “antisemitism.”The two  abuses of antisemitism have agendas. On the Right the exaggeration of increased  antisemitism on campus was related to a campaign to defend Israel. Antisemitism  was hijacked as a way to color all anti-Israel views as antisemitic and the very  real dangers of real antisemitism was ignored to achieve the larger pro-Israel  goal. The boycott movement, apartheid week, Palestinian flags – it’s all  “antisemitism.”The Left’s voices against antisemitism also have an  Israel- centric narrative to them, that seeks to tar pro-Israel groups as not  only whitewashing antisemitism but being tied to Trump to discredit them. “Trump  lends hope to Israel’s right,” The New York Times claimed. “Trump emboldens  Israel’s far right,” wrote Saeb Erakat. America’s “most powerful Jewish  organizations” have “kept quiet during the most bigoted presidential campaign in  history,” wrote Peter Beinart.They even perform the trick of pulling an  antisemitic rabbit out of a Zionist hat. “Strange but true that many ardent  Zionists view Western antisemitism as good,” wrote journalist Dan Murphy on  Twitter. “How Bannon and Brietbart can be pro-Israel and antisemitic at the same  time,” headlined The Forward. In the article Todd Gitlin at Columbia University  claimed that “the coexistence of antisemitism and right-wing Zionism ‘in Trump’s  world make sense.’” A new narrative is forming to claim that Zionism is actually  a form of antisemitism. This fulfills a kind of fantasy on parts the Left  whereby being pro-Israel will now be seen as a component of being antisemitic,  which will mean that the reality of radical-left antisemitism will forever be  inured from claims it is antisemitic.“Israeli Right works with  antisemites” is that goal many anti-Zionists have always had in mind since the  1920s when they suggested that Zionism was a form of antisemitism because it  called into question the place of Diaspora Jewry. The strange intersection of  this election has allowed this fringe view to take center stage.Rarely  in history has antisemitism been so politicized, so untethered from real acts of  antisemitism. Can we escape the train wreck that is about to happen, where some  elements of the Left tar Zionism as antisemitism and the Right stays mired in  its over-use of claims of antisemitism? In the recent documentary The Last  Laugh, co-writers Ferne Pearlstein and Robert Edwards looked at comedians making  fun of the Holocaust. In the film many comedians, such as Sarah Silverman, make  fun of the genocide, calling it “alleged Holocaust” in one scene. She’s mocking  antisemites, but what happens when antisemites think it’s funny? There is also  “Holocaust fatigue,” says Edwards. “When it gets to the point where people roll  their eyes and it has no effect anymore, then you have a real problem.” Have we  watered it down too much? In the 2013 Pew Survey, “remembering the Holocaust”  was the most important aspect of Jewish identity for 73 percent of American  Jews. Antisemitism is a major portion of identity. But we’ve also educated  generations to see more antisemitism than there is, to mock the Holocaust while  at the same time seeing a new Holocaust as just around the corner as media  claims we live in the 1930s.Claiming “antisemitism” is easy, but that’s  precisely why it should be done sparingly.
Too much crying wolf over  antisemitism has harmed its meaning. It is also leading to shocking levels of  people believing they are just years away from being sent to concentration  camps. An honest discussion should be had on the Left and Right of American  Jewry to stop exaggerating and work to confront real incidents of antisemitism  and not waste time inventing bogeymen and fearmongering.

<title>The America I remember has undergone a face-lift</title>
<date>9/8/2016</date>
<content>
Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, I didn’t ask friends if they were  pro-Israel. It was a given.Nearly every American who valued life,  liberty, and freedom stood with Israel. Why? It was simple: because Israel is  America’s greatest ally, and the only country in the Middle East that stands for  the principles of democracy and justice that are too rare in the  region.




But times have changed. The world has gotten more complicated –  and more confused.When I was growing up, the world still remembered that  Israel offered citizenship to Arabs who stayed in the country after Israel’s war  for independence, despite the calls from so many Arab leaders to evacuate and  then return when Israel had been destroyed.When I was young, citizens  across America recognized that Israel had won difficult wars through strategy  and miracles, never emulating our enemies’ despicable tactics of mass killings,  random attacks against innocent civilians, or widespread campaigns of  lies.In the America I was raised in, Israel was a shining light unto the  nations, confirmation to the world that “the good guys” ultimately win. The  State of Israel was a stark reminder that God is very much alive in this crazy  and unpredictable world, and that His promise to Israel made so many years ago  in biblical times still stands.Yet visiting America for six weeks this  summer, it became clear to me that the America I remember has undergone a  face-lift.On a Tuesday afternoon, I turned on my TV to see Israeli flags  being burned outside of the Democratic National Convention.On my way to  work I heard former KKK leader David Duke speak about running for the US Senate  on the platform of “returning America to its European roots,” and clarifying  that Jews are from the Middle East.The daily news headlines show once  unimaginable quotes of politicians debating “the Israel issue.” Recently, Jill  Stein – the Green Party’s nominee for President of the United States – stated  that she would end military aid to “apartheid” Israel.The truth is, it’s  terrifying and nauseating. Anti-Israel rhetoric became a legitimate mainstream  position just recently, and as experts have warned, that has led the way to  blatant anti-Semitism being tolerated.But this can’t be true in the  Jewish community, right? Shockingly, as I saw firsthand: wrong.I landed  in South Carolina in a small plane, ready to start my marathon day of meetings.  First I headed to an African-American Baptist church. I sat with the pastor for  hours, as he pledged to me that “as long as I am the pastor of this church, we  stand with Israel. If that means losing some congregants – so be it!” With  excitement, he told me his feelings on every one of Israel’s prime ministers  since 1948, and what he appreciated in each of them. He proudly showed me photos  from the hundreds of talks, sermons, and drives he has done for Israel. “My  passion in life is Israel, and it is my greatest honor,” he said. Together, we  formulated more ways he can get involved in supporting the Holy  Land.Inspired and motivated to continue the momentum, I headed to  meetings with Jewish pro-Israel leaders and a local rabbi.“This can be  awesome,” I told them, as I laid out my vision for uniting local Jews and  Christians to rally and openly stand with Israel. But their faces remained  neutral.“The Jewish community is extremely wary of publicly standing  with Israel,” the rabbi sadly said. Shocked, my smile faded too. “Why?” I asked  him.Unable to hide his embarrassment, he answered, “Too  controversial.”I asked the rabbi if the pastor I met represented most  Christians in his state, and he answered immediately.“Yes! They are our  strongest friends.” He also confirmed that the Jewish position to “not deal with  Israel” is gaining terrifying traction.It took a few minutes to collect  my thoughts. A black Christian pastor is educated and unapologetically  supportive of Israel, while many American Jews won’t educate their young or even  discuss Israel – their very own homeland. How sad and disturbing.A 2013  Pew research study showed that a higher percentage of Christians than Jews in  America believe that God gave Israel to the Jewish people. The same percentage  of Jews and Christians believe that America is not supportive enough of Israel  (a whopping 30%).As Bob Dylan once said, “The times, they are a  changin’.”When I was young, I never heard of a Jew embarrassed to  support Israel. Whether I visited friends in Conservative or Reform Temples, or  went to services in my Orthodox shul, Israel was our pride and joy. It was the  issue that unified us all.As I return to Israel, I realize that the  America I knew is not the America that I now know. Everything has been turned  upside down. Jewish support for Israel is waning, and Christian support is  growing.
So much is uncertain. But one thing is crystal clear: the Jewish  and Christian pro-Israel communities must stand unified in our love and support  for Israel and pledge to unashamedly educate the next generation to do so as  well. Because if our religious leaders are staying silent on “the Israel issue,”  the only other place our children and grandchildren will learn about it is in  the news.

<title>The discriminatory laws that do not discriminate</title>
<date>9/8/2016</date>
<content>
On Thursday, the Movement for Black Lives announced it would engage in BDS  actions against Israel because, among other reasons, “Israel is an apartheid  state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the  Palestinian people.” It credits Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority  Rights in Israel, as one of its “organizations currently working on policy.” The movement is  an offshoot of the American organization Black Lives Matter.Adalah calls  itself “an independent human rights organization,” and thus its statements enjoy  some of the halo effect attached to this self-anointed status.




But Adalah  has goals far beyond human rights. It seeks to nullify Israel as a Jewish state  – as the nation state of the Jewish people.Thus it promotes a  constitution for Israel that would grant citizenship to all Palestinian refugees  and all their descendants, wiping out the Jewish majority in Israel, and its  provisions substitute a bi-national state for the Jewish one, with no “right of  return for Jews” and with mechanisms to eliminate all Jewish symbols.One  of its most effective tools to delegitimize the Jewish state is the compilation  and dissemination of its list of “more than 50 Israeli laws enacted since 1948  that directly or indirectly discriminate against Palestinian citizens of  Israel.” This is the list that the Movement for Black Lives found so compelling  that they embraced the BDS goals to work against Israel, which they call the  “apartheid state.”What are the laws on this nefarious list and how do  they discriminate? This is what the Institute for Zionist strategies set out to  determine, and it recently completed a comprehensive analysis of every one of  these laws. The study examines the text of the laws, their purposes, how they  have been implemented, and how they compare to similar laws in other  democracies.The full report (Hebrew) and the English Introduction and  Summary can be found on the IZS website and Facebook page. Here is what it  found.A basic underlying presumption used to condemn 21 of the 57 laws,  is that any enactment defining or promoting Israel as the nation state of the  Jewish people discriminates against Arab citizens of Israel (e.g., the flag law  and the law to support Yad Ben Zvi, a prominent institution promoting Zionist  study and values). But this flawed premise would delegitimize the vast majority  of the world’s democracies, which are also nation states – that is, states  established by and for a predominant ethnic or religious majority. As I pointed  out in a Wall Street Journal article explaining the proposed Basic Law: Israel  as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, “Most of the more than 60 democracies  are built on the ethnic identity of a predominant group, which molds the  character of the state while affording minorities full civil and religious  rights. In this regard the Jewish state of Israel is a typical democratic  country.”But Adalah goes far beyond this flawed proposition. For  example, it lists as one of its 57 discriminatory laws the Trading with the  Enemy Act (an Ordinance continued from British Mandatory law designed to fight  Nazi Germany).This law prohibits trade with “enemy nationals.” It is  discriminatory against Arab citizens, Adalah claims, because “Thus far, all  “enemy states’ all of are Arab and/ or Muslim states” [sic]. Israel could  presumably cure this “discrimination” either by allowing free and untrammeled  intercourse with Syria and Iran or by adding Great Britain, France and  Switzerland to its list of enemies.Adalah claims that laws designed to  protect citizens against terrorism are discriminatory because the predominant  majority of terrorists are Arabs. What democratic country would repeal laws  defending against terrorist attacks because the suspected terrorists caught and  charged were predominantly Muslims or Arabs? Laws that provide equal rights for  both majority and minority groups are nevertheless labeled discriminatory by  Adalah. The Law and Administration Ordinance (1948) that defines the country’s  official rest days, and the Law for Using the Hebrew Date, both explicitly  exclude institutions and authorities that serve non-Jewish  populations.All members of minorities are guaranteed a day of rest on  the day specified by his/her recognized religious faith or on Saturday, at the  employee’s option. Apparently, Israeli law on Saturday is discriminatory, but  not Moslem and Arab countries with Friday or Christian countries with Sunday  (most of which do not protect minorities’ day of rest). But one thing is for  sure, no Jew is discriminated on his day of rest in most of the Arab countries,  because the Jews were kicked out in the late 1940s and early  1950s.Adalah outdoes itself by including the Golan Heights Law on its  list.The Golan Heights were captured in the 1967 war started by Syria  and Egypt. The law in question grants citizenship and equal rights to all  inhabitants of the Golan Heights.The only minority residents living  there are Druze, and the law prohibits any and all discrimination.This  law granting equality to all residents is denounced as discriminatory against  Palestinian Arabs, none of whom live or work there.Every single one of  the 57 laws listed by Adalah list is proven by the Institute for Zionist  Strategies study to be non-discriminatory. Anyone can read the laws and the  Institute’s conclusions on the IZS site to verify this fact for him/herself. One  can also visit the Adalah site, for many of its claims are absurd on their  face.Adalah, of course needs money to compile this list, to draft  constitutions, to build attractive Internet sites in three languages, and to  appear all over the world before international organizations to condemn Israel.  On paper, it would seem like a perfect candidate for funds from the EU, European  states (and EU-funded NGOs), and the New Israel Fund.And so it is. As  reported by NGO Monitor, Adalah received generous funding from: Broederlijk  Delen (Belgium), Bread for the World- EED (Germany), Federal Department of  Foreign Affairs (Switzerland), Oxfam-Novib (Netherlands), Human Rights and  International Law Secretariat (joint funding from Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark  and the Netherlands), Christian Aid (UK), European Union, UNDP, and others. From  2012 to 2015, Adalah received direct funding from foreign governmental bodies of  NIS 12,719,902. From 2008 to 2014, the New Israel Fund, which tells its donors  that it will not support BDS efforts and that it will support Israel, authorized  grants for Adalah in the amount of $1,874,656.And this funding continued  into 2015.The Movement for Black Lives credits Adalah for its general  help and clearly justifies its resolve to engage in BDS activities by invoking  Adalah’s list of “discriminatory laws.” The Movement, which declared that the US  “is complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people,” does  not seem very interested in seeking or speaking truth. Its reliance on Adalah’s  list is therefore not surprising – no matter how reckless. But Adalah is not a  new group, it is generously endowed, and it surely knows that the 57  “discriminatory laws” on its list do not discriminate.

<title>The former generals’ opening shots</title>
<date>19/6/2016</date>
<content>
Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might recently have strengthened his  Knesset majority with Yisrael Beytenu’s joining the coalition, his stature as  the country’s leader is becoming weaker every day.In some respects, this  is inevitable. In every Western democracy, once a leader spends over a decade in  power (either through consecutive election wins like Margaret Thatcher, Tony  Blair or Angela Merkel, or cumulatively as in Netanyahu’s case), the country  eventually tires of them. Thatcher was pushed out of office by her own members  of parliament, who felt her hardline image would cost the Conservative Party the  next election; Blair, worn down by the Iraq War and internal party sniping, went  of his own accord, while Merkel is no longer secure in her position of “Mutti,”  the mother of the German nation, as mass immigration begins to change the face  of modern Germany.




Israel, too, is tiring of Netanyahu and, it has to be  said, his footlight-hogging wife.The long-running soap opera concerning  the unbecoming behavior of Mrs. Netanyahu is no longer a matter of tittle-tattle  in the press, but a series of court cases in which former employees at the Prime  Minister’s Residence have successfully sued for suffering emotional and verbal  abuse at the hands of Sara Netanyahu.With the police recommending last  month that Sara stand trial on graft allegations, accusing her of improper  behavior and misuse of state funds relating to the Prime Minister’s Residence,  including receiving goods under false pretenses, falsifying documents and breach  of trust, the Netanyahus’ home life is going to remain under unpleasant scrutiny  for weeks to come.And their behavior while on public duty is hardly any  better. A five-day trip to the United States last year cost the Israeli taxpayer  a staggering NIS 6.7 million ($1.73m.), a sum which Netanyahu tried to hide from  public scrutiny.Once the cost ($1.5m.) of the specially chartered flight  is stripped out, the remaining expenses are eye-watering.Netanyahu’s  carefully coiffed hair cost you and me $1,600, while his make-up assistant  artist charged $1,750. And rather than meet his guests at the Israeli consulate  in New York, Netanyahu insisted on having his hotel rooms refitted into meeting  rooms, at the cost of almost $20,000.We’ve been here before with the  Netanyahus and their flagrant abuse of the public purse (pistachio ice cream  anybody?) and it hasn’t cost him an election, but now his image as a strong  leader, who knows what’s best for the country’s future, is also coming under  increasing attack.THE DEVASTATING critiques of Netanyahu’s leadership  from former defense ministers and ex-chiefs of general staff Ehud Barak and  Moshe Ya’alon last week landed a critical blow on the prime minister’s standing.  While the motives of both Barak and Ya’alon can be questioned, given that the  two of them were previously happy to serve under Netanyahu, their assessments,  each in their own style, of where Netanyahu is leading the country were  laser-accurate.Barak’s warning that the most rightwing government in the  country’s history has a covert agenda to make the two-state solution untenable,  leading either to an apartheid state or a binational one in which Jews face  being the minority within a generation or two is a stark statement of the facts.  Ya’alon’s description of a government taken over by a “fanatical core group with  a radical ideology” that freely attacks the Supreme Court, the freedom of  expression and other principles of democracy also hits the mark. And when a  former Israeli prime minister talks, as Barak did, of “budding fascism” stalking  the country, it’s time to pay attention.The problem is, neither Barak  nor Ya’alon are in a position to bring down Netanyahu in the immediate to near  future – nor is anybody else. On the same day that they launched their  broadsides against the prime minister, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog also  blasted the government, sarcastically calling out “Naftali ‘Batman’ Bennett” and  “Popeye Liberman.”But despite his rhetorical ammunition, Herzog is a  spent weapon. His fateful decision to negotiate with Netanyahu about joining his  government has neutered the Labor leader as a potential prime ministerial rival.  Nothing Herzog says or does from now on in opposition to Netanyahu will be taken  seriously, given the eagerness he showed to crawl into the  coalition.Netanyahu is vulnerable, both on a personal level and in terms  of a growing aware ness that he’s leading this country to disaster. The  challenge facing those in the Center and the Left is to find a candidate with  the ability to energize the electorate and bring the prime minister down, before  it’s too late. Herzog has blown his opportunity.

<title>The French Revolution</title>
<date>13/7/2016</date>
<content>
In December 2009, a British court issued a warrant for the arrest of then foreign minister Tzipi Livni over alleged war crimes committed by the Israeli government during Operation Cast Lead. Consequently, Livni decided not to take any chances and canceled her planned trip to a Jewish National Fund conference in London. But this threat followed her once again this past Sunday, when on her way to a conference in London she was summoned by Scotland Yard’s War Crimes unit for questioning.There was no shortage of Israeli organizations that joined the fray of accusing Israel of war crimes for its activities during Cast Lead. Some were gathered under the umbrella organization Coalition of Women for Peace, and some, like Zochrot and Israel Social TV, acted alone.




These organizations receive funding from foreign political entities and governments including Holland, Germany, Norway and the European Union. This foreign funding is used to accuse Israel on a daily basis of war crimes, apartheid, ethnic cleansing and more. These funds also promote a policy of boycott against Israel, and represent the clear product of the campaign of delegitimization and dehumanization against Israel.Another common denominator shared between these organizations is that they would all be affected by the Transparency Bill, which is going to the Knesset plenum for a vote next week. Given this, it is surprising to discover that the very person leading the opposition against this bill is none other than MK Tzipi Livni, who almost spent the night in a London prison cell because of these very organizations.Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn once in a while, and this week Livni sounded very different when speaking in London: “The British legal system unfortunately is being abused by those who seek to blur the moral distinction between those fighting terror and those defending it, and we cannot accept that, especially because of the good relations between our countries and the partnership of values and interests.”At the same time Livni is assuming the role of savior of democracy and freedom by condemning those who seek to convict her and other Israeli officials by circumventing the Israeli judicial system and turning to international tribunals, she is voicing the complete opposite view in Israel. In the UK, and only in the UK, Livni seems to understand and recognize the problems of such organizations engaging in lawfare against a democratic state that is fighting a war against terrorists.Livni and her colleagues from the Zionist Left must understand that this “British problem” is nothing compared to the problem in Israel. Only a sick democracy allows foreign governments to meddle in its internal affairs and advance a policy that undermines its very right to exist.These delegitimization organizations are not “human rights” organizations, rather they are political pawns implanted in Israeli society by foreign governments to serve their interests. This objective was best illustrated by Britain’s former minister of Middle East affairs, Alistair Burt, who noted: “Since we began supporting these programs some significant changes have been made in the Israeli justice system, both civilian and military, and in the decisions they make.”It is the right and the obligation of the Knesset to institute transparency laws governing organizations that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments, the very same organizations that were leading the calls to convict Livni and other Israeli officials for alleged war crimes. The Transparency Bill is just a drop in the bucket of the parliamentary action needed to halt this anti-democratic intrusion.Take France, for example, whose Penal Code states that contacting a foreign government or a foreign organization with the intent of engaging in hostile activities toward France is punishable by 30 years’ imprisonment and a fine of over 450,000 euros. Israel should also be wise enough to protect itself and see to it that the right to freedom of expression is not distorted into the right to freedom of incitement.Tzipi Livni above all else symbolizes one who suffers from a severe case of Stockholm syndrome, as she has been leading the charge against the bill that seeks to defend Israeli democracy from foreign persecution and arrests. In one of the Knesset committees discussing the bill, Devorah Gonen, a bereaved mother whose son Danny was murdered last year by terrorists, expressed the sentiment shared by many other bereaved families: “Foreign governments are funding the murder of Jews and we need to stop it.”It would be wise for the leader of the Hatnuah Party to understand this and stop defending those who are advocating for her arrest. If not for her own sake, then at least for the sake of Israeli democracy and sovereignty.

<title>The gentle mentor</title>
<date>31/3/2016</date>
<content>
Joe Blumberg was a mentor. An outstanding newspaperman, he mentored a whole  generation of aspiring journalists at The Jerusalem Post, where he was a senior  editor between 1963 and 1990. He would gently calm down a hysterical junior  staffer whose copy had been ripped to shreds by a rampaging news editor and say,  “Well, perhaps we could do it better this way,” and impart a gem of newspaper  wisdom.One of the places where Joe, who died in Ashkelon on March 21 at  the age of 95, acquired his experience was Drum, the South African news magazine  for blacks, where he worked in the 1950s. On pay day, his black colleagues would  line up for interest-free and rarely repaid loans from him. He also worked at  the leading liberal South African daily, the Rand Daily Mail, and moonlighted at  the Zionist Record. From 1956 to 1957, he and his family moved to London, where  he worked for the prestigious Reuters news agency.




After the Sharpeville  massacre, when 69 peaceful black demonstrators were killed by police in March  1960, Joe had enough of the oppressive apartheid regime and immigrated to Israel  with wife, Flora, and children Susan and Philip-Danny in the summer of 1962. A  third child, Dena, was born in Israel.After a spell at Kibbutz Tel Yosef  in the Jezreel Valley, Joe went to look for work. The only option for an  English-language newspaperman in those days was The Jerusalem Post.Ari  Rath, then the Post’s managing editor and subsequent editor-in-chief  (1975-1989), takes up the story.“When he first introduced himself to me  at the Post, with his rich experience at the Rand Daily Mail fighting apartheid  and later with Reuters at Fleet Street in London, I realized right away that he  would be an asset for us, although his Hebrew was somewhat lacking.An  avid pipe smoker, Joe would come to work with his legendary pipe bag, since he  would have to keep the pipes dry and change them regularly during an eight-hour  shift.”Rath’s co-editor in those years, Erwin Frenkel, has this to say  about Joe: “To the small circle of reporters and editors that made up The  Jerusalem Post before 1967, Joe brought a quietly persuasive professionalism  honed by his formative journalistic experience in South Africa and  England.“His editorial pen was deft in repairing ambiguous or turgid  texts. But his presence was soon felt even more keenly by the sense of style  that he introduced to the pressure tasks of news-page layouts and writing  headlines in the now almost forgotten days of print journalism.“He  represented in that way a vital link between the small island of  English-language journalism in a remote Jerusalem, and the standard-setting  centers of English journalism abroad. That served the paper well as it grew and  expanded after the Six Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of  1973.“With that growth, Joe was appointed editor of the Post’s overseas  weekly edition, which was nourished by his good judgment and editing  skills.“Joe’s professionalism was matched by a self-effacing good humor,  not common to newsrooms, which always blunted the pain for the victims of his  editing surgery. It also made him a warmly valued colleague and, for many years,  a pillar of the old Post.”The old Post was different from the somewhat  depleted and sterile atmosphere of today’s terminally afflicted print  journalism. The night news desk was replete with hard-bitten, hard-drinking,  chain-smoking copy editors hailing from the far corners of the globe, banging  away on ancient typewriters with news teleprinters chattering away in the  background. Here, Joe was in his element.A fellow senior editor in the  “old days” was Malka Rabinowitz, who remembers Joe as “a wonderful human being  and colleague. He always had time for you, whether it was professional or  personal.”One of his protégés, whom he guided through the junior  reporter’s first faltering steps, was Hirsh Goodman, later to become creator and  editor of The Jerusalem Report.Goodman writes: “He was a mentor who saw  in me what I did not see in myself; treated me as an equal, despite the quarter  century between us.”JOE WAS BORN in Johannesburg in 1920. His parents,  Avraham and Eva, were from Latvia. He belonged to the Zionist Socialist  movement, and when World War II broke out, he joined the South African Army. He  was assigned to the Transvaal Scottish Regiment and fought in the bitter North  African campaign. His service with the Transvaal Scottish earned him the  nickname “Jock,” by which he was known to family and friends. While on leave  from the fighting, he visited close relatives living in Palestine, traveling by  train from Cairo to Tel Aviv.After the war he studied literature and  began working as a journalist. He was also a keen amateur jazz pianist, and  throughout his life enjoyed playing and listening to jazz, talking knowledgeably  about it and introducing the uninitiated to its delights. He did the same with  good books, about which, rather unusually for a journalist, he was quietly  erudite and up to date.He had an amazing way with people and had many  friends of all ages.Several years after the death of Flora in 1985, he  retired from the Post and moved to Ashkelon, where he lived till his  death.Joe never owned a car in Israel, and his friends ascribe his  longevity to the fact that he’d go everywhere on foot, often walking miles to  and from work, always carrying his shoulder bag full of his pipes and books. His  friends ascribe his longevity to this practice despite, or perhaps because of,  the fact that at his destination, he would immediately light up a cigarillo and  enjoy a glass or three of whisky.

<title>The human spirit: Dear Margot</title>
<date>21/1/2016</date>
<content>
I’m 10 years old. Soldiers and healthcare workers place me on a boat which  sails from Germany to Sweden. The dock leads to a long boardwalk. Walking is so  difficult that even a few hundred feet feel like a marathon. In the end,  I am too weak to walk, so they carry me.“I am transferred to the  so-called aliens camp in Bjarred, a coastal town that’s 20 kilometers north of  Malmö.




“In Sweden, we’re given pudding and jelly to help heal and fill  our shrunken stomachs. The nurses know about those of us who died from eating  the wrong food in Bergen-Belsen. We eat bland potatoes and fish balls, fruit,  and berries of all kinds, sweet cream and sour cream. We have to drink fish oil,  and we comply even though it tastes bad. We get thick pancakes for breakfast.  We’re encouraged to play outside and to bask in the sunshine while it lasts. We  get new clothing, including warm wool coats.“How lonely I am. Throughout  the war, I hoped that my parents would somehow return. I was waiting to tell  them everything that had happened to me since we parted.“Papa promised  to meet me after the war. He surely must be coming for me. I hope that my  parents are somehow safe in Palestine and will come for me. Even as I hope, in  my heart of hearts, I know they aren’t coming back, and that I am alone in the  world.“At last, my body lice are gone but I am so sick that I am  transferred to a hospital in Hässleholm, a nearby town. There I am diagnosed  with both typhus and diphtheria.“My mind is fuzzy. I have to overcome my  illness. When I am well enough to think clearly, months have gone  by.“In the hospital, there are Swedish families who visit. They  are so healthy looking and attractive: blond, neatly dressed with round faces  and bright blue eyes. Sometimes their eyes get teary when they visit  me. Someone tells me they have seen the photographs of us in  Bergen-Belsen.“There was no war in Sweden. I don’t understand how that  can be. Children here went to school, had birthday parties, enjoyed thick  pancakes with syrup while we were starving.“Now these nice men and women  want to help me. The Swedes are energetic, straightforward and  punctual. They have a sort of no-nonsense approach to getting things  done, combined with a warm, human touch.“I can never judge Sweden. I was  reborn in Sweden. I will be forever grateful to that country and its  people.”Rena Quint, a daughter of many mothers To Margot Wallström  Shalom Ms. Wallström, I’ve been thinking a lot of the passage above, as I follow  your career as foreign minister of Sweden, particularly your outspokenness about  two Middle Eastern countries, Saudi Arabia and Israel.As a woman, a  contemporary of yours and fellow feminist, I have been eager to see what the  application of what you call “feminist policy” means in the real world. The  women of Saudi Arabia will have to answer for the reactions of their own  country, but I want to share my thoughts about your attitude to  Israel.Here you have been accused of anti-Semitism. I don’t think you  are an anti-Semite.Our prime minister has said that your comments about  us summarily executing knife-wielding terrorists is “outrageous... immoral  and... stupid.” You can’t be stupid. You have such an impressive career. You  have served as minister of social affairs, civil affairs, including consumer  affairs, women and youth, and minister of culture. You were elected to the  Swedish parliament at the age of 25. In 2006, you were voted the most popular  woman in Sweden, more popular than actress Anita Ekberg and Queen  Silvia.So why do you misjudge us Israelis? My theory is that in your  extreme efforts to be a moral influence in the world, you over-identify with  those you see as the underdog, no matter how immoral they are. You are  influenced by an old European romanticism over the noble native, and so have  created a legend that the Palestinians live lives of penury, abuse and  apartheid-like discrimination at the hands of us Big Bad Israelis.You’re  so committed to this skewed view that when your own continent is threatened by  terrorism, it’s somehow our fault, too. When we defend ourselves against  knife-wielding terrorists, you see us as the perpetrators.Perhaps you  think that because of the young age of some of the terrorists, the knives are  ninja toys. I know you have a close relationship with United Nations Secretary-  General Ban Ki-moon, who last May appointed you a member of the High-Level Panel  on Humanitarian Financing, an initiative aimed at preparing recommendations for  the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.When Ban was in Israel recently, he  visited Richard Lakin, an American-born civil rights marcher, English teacher  for Jewish and Palestinian youth and social activist, in the intensive care unit  of Hadassah University Medical Center. Tutored by instructions on the Internet,  the Palestinian teenager inflicted knife injuries that were so extreme –  systematic cutting through the internal organs – that all the antibiotics in the  world couldn’t stave off the infection that killed Lakin.You would have  liked Lakin, a person who had dedicated his life to freedom. But imagine that it  was your beloved husband or one of your two sons daydreaming on a bus in  Jerusalem or Stockholm when an armed terrorist boarded. How would you have  stopped him before he murdered everyone on the bus? One of the terrorists in the  attack did survive and shared the intensive care unit with Lakin. The secretary-  general of the United Nations didn’t want to visit him.Because of the  danger of the knife attacks, particularly the stabbing of my husband’s colleague  lecturing at Aish HaTorah in the Old City, I have been thinking about buying  protective clothing for our family. Despite the situation, our local camping  store isn’t stocking flak jackets. Body armor for riot police is for sale  online, but I can’t imagine my husband, who bikes to work, decked out like the  medieval knights who arrived in the Crusades. I phoned the manufacturer of  lightweight protective jackets, designed for homeland security and prison guards  in England.The helpful sales rep in England wanted to make sure that I  knew the jackets aren’t foolproof. “We have a lot of customers calling from  Israel these days, and I must tell you that this jacket is slash-proof but it  won’t stop a terrorist stabbing you.”Suddenly a new vocabulary:  slash-proof, stab-proof.What do you think, Ms. Wallström? Should we  Israelis start wearing armor instead of shooting the terrorists who attack us?  These are matters you’ll have to consider yourself.Your country is 20  times the size of ours, with a slightly larger population: 9.8 million in Sweden  and 8.5 million in Israel. Last year when you took in 16,785 Syrian refugees, we  took in 26,500 Jews, many leaving troubled Europe.To keep your  population numbers close to replacement level, you rely on immigration because  of your lower birthrate. These days you are getting so many men that you soon  will have more men than women in Sweden – not a good strategy for future  population growth. In addition, you’ve changed your open-door policy to one that  deters asylum-seekers, and are now embracing what’s called “the EU minimum.”  That must be a moral dilemma, like the one you faced to maintain your neutrality  in World War II.You took in sick children like my friend Rena Quint  after the war, but during the war closed your gates to hundreds of thousands of  Jews who went to their deaths. Those who survived aren’t willing to stand idly  by while we are stabbed or slashed. I know you aren’t either.Sincerely,
Barbara Sofer, Jerusalem

<title>The invisible industry of deceit</title>
<date>25/7/2016</date>
<content>
The student, a young woman from a Christian university in the United States,  looked at me and in a voice filled with pathos asked, “But why does Israel steal  water from the Palestinians?” I answered her question with a question: “Do you  know factually that Israel ‘steals’ water from the Palestinians?” “Well,” she  said, “this is what they told us.”“They” in this case could have been a  speaker from Palestinian Authority-based institutions such as Bethlehem Bible  College, the east Jerusalem YMCA, the Siraj Center for Holy Land Studies in Beit  Sahour, or the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center; or perhaps a  foreign-based organization such as Interfaith Peace Builders (American),  Christian Peacemaker Teams (American), World Vision (British); or even a  representative of any of a number of politically Left Israeli (Jewish) NGOs that  draw from the Palestinian narrative, such as B’Tselem, Peace Now or Rabbis for  Human Rights. “They” told us, so it must be true.




This student is but one  of the myriad overseas visitors to Israel and the PA who at any given point  during the year may be found taking part in some organized program of subtle  political indoctrination. Collectively, these activities constitute an invisible  industry of lies and deceit. Invisible because they arouse virtually no  attention, including of the government of the State of Israel. These programs  represent the independent efforts of many organizations. They are not  coordinated or run by a central authority. All these organizations, however,  share one fundamental objective, and that is to proselytize the message that the  Palestinians are an oppressed people and the State of Israel is the  oppressor.This industry has operatives throughout Western countries who  carry on its work overseas, particularly on college campuses where their  activities help fuel the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions)  movement.They also find homes in many church-affiliated institutions,  and in doing so are able to target a wide age range. An important part of this  work consists of recruiting people who will fly to Israel as part of a group,  take part in an “educational” program based on a carefully chosen roster of  lecturers and visits, enjoy ample Palestinian home hospitality, and when it is  all over, hopefully return home and become locally active on behalf of the  Palestinian national movement.The NGO Monitor website describes one of  the most active among the Palestinian Authority-based propaganda organizations,  Holy Land Trust, as follows: “Conducts highly politicized tours promoting the  Palestinian narrative and targeting church leaders and the international  community, claiming to provide ‘cross cultural and experimental learning  opportunities in both Palestine and Israel.’ Suggests that its participants  ‘limit information’ given to Israeli airport security and hide the reason for  their visits.”The Holy Land Trust’s sophisticated and aesthetically  attractive website boasts a variety of programs.This summer HLT will be  sponsoring the 13th Annual Summer Encounter, that targets a college-age  population.Wherein lies the deception? From reading the description of  the program from the website, one is likely to believe that the Summer Encounter  is an innocuous, even apolitical, one- or two-month volunteer community service  program that offers an opportunity to learn Arabic. In fact, the program is  peppered with experiences that clearly promote the message that Palestinians  live under a cruel and unjust Israeli occupation. For example, a visit to  Israel’s Yad VaShem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem, a visit one might  think is used to create some empathy with the experience of the Jewish people  and the rationale for the creation of the Jewish state, is in fact used as a  basis for comparison with the Aida and Dheisheh refugee camps in the Bethlehem  area.This visit has, on occasion, engendered the inane question: “How can you  Jews do to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to you?” Because this is an  “invisible industry” there is no way of knowing how many overseas visitors  participate in these programs annually. The Tourism Ministry does not keep track  of tourists who enter the country and later cross the 1949 Armistice Line (the  “Green Line”) to spend time traveling in the PA. But my own informal  observations and calculations lead me to believe that their total number reaches  into the tens of thousands and is likely to be growing.Who are these  people and why do they come? With over 20 years of experience addressing these  types of groups in my community of Efrat, I have learned that within a typical  group of some 20-30 participants, approximately 10 percent arrive with an  existing political bias that favors the Palestinian narrative; another  approximately 10% have literally just come along for the ride. They relate to  the trip as a Middle East vacation experience and have no idea of what awaits  them.That leaves about the 80% in many groups who arrive in Israel as  “fence sitters.” This is to say that even if their political world view leans  Left, they could not, upon arrival at Ben-Gurion Airport, be considered  anti-Israel, anti-Zionist and definitely not anti-Semitic. Most are generally  ignorant or confused concerning the historical details surrounding the  protracted Arab-Israeli conflict, including the conflict with the PA.In  fact, in many cases, these individuals’ greater awareness of the conflict only  begins to take shape in the weeks before departing for home, the result of  reading a number of books and viewing a number of Internet sites, all with a  clear pro-Palestinian bias, that were recommended by their tour  sponsors.This 80% is the prime target population of the program  organizers. Ignorance or naiveté combined with a good heart are the  characteristics that allow these programs to mold these participants by exposing  them to certain experiences while denying them others.In addition, these  groups are repeatedly exposed to a politicized lexicon centered on words such as  “occupation,” “resistance,” “injustice,” “apartheid,” “genocide.” Historical  facts are either blurred, perverted or invented. By the time their program ends  and they leave Israel, some participants would now openly acknowledge having  become anti-Zionist.How does this transformation come about, and in such  a relatively short amount of time? More than targeting these visitors’ minds  these programs target their hearts. The people who develop and operate these  programs, the “captains of this industry of deceit,” learned long ago that if  you first capture peoples’ hearts, their minds follow. Once participants have  been emotionally won over to the Palestinian cause, through home hospitality,  interactions with children, visits to the injured, and joining in festive family  celebrations, they have no interest in questioning the veracity of the dubious  “facts” they are presented.That is why when this Christian college  student was told that “Israel steals the water from the Palestinians,” she  accepted the statement as fact. If she was also told “Israel steals oxygen from  Palestinian airspace” I am certain that she would have believed that as  well.

For many years, members of anti-Israel student groups such as Students for  Justice in Palestine (SJP) have charged that they are being unfairly accused of  antisemitism for simply “criticizing Israeli policy.”Of late, however,  those charges are ringing extremely hollow.




With increasing frequency,  SJP and similar student groups are making it clear that their primary goal is  not simply to criticize Israeli policy, but to advocate for the complete  elimination of Israel and its replacement by a Palestinian state:A coalition  of several New York City chapters of SJP adopted as its logo the outline of the  entire State of Israel filled in with the colors of the Palestinian flag and  declared in its mission statement: “We support the One State Solution and  understand that it is the only possible end result of the struggle to liberate  ALL of Palestine.”In recent years at the University of California  Irvine, the annual series of Israel-bashing events, including talks by  individuals calling for the elimination of the Jewish state, is officially known  as “Anti-Zionism Week.”Chants of “From the river to the sea Palestine  will be free!,” blatant calls for a Palestinian state not alongside but in place  of Israel, are de rigueur at anti-Israel rallies on campuses across the  US.These examples and dozens more just like them are not mere criticism  of Israel and are not intended to result in a peaceful solution.Rather,  they uncover the true antisemitic intentions of SJP – the elimination of the  only Jewish state. They are perfect examples of “eliminationist  anti-Zionism.”Let’s be clear: criticism of the Israeli government and  Israeli policies, including settlements, the separation barrier and the living  conditions of Palestinians, is not antisemitism and is appropriate and welcomed  on a college campus. Calls for the elimination or destruction of Israel,  however, cross the line.The US government, global leaders including  President Barack Obama, Pope Francis, the prime ministers of Canada, Britain and  France and the 31 nations of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,  the world’s preeminent scholars of antisemitism and the vast majority of world  Jewry all recognize this type of expression for the blatant antisemitism that it  is. In fact, the University of California recently became the first US school to  acknowledge that expressions of anti-Zionism are “assertions of prejudice and  intolerance toward Jewish people and culture,” and a form of antisemitism that  has “no place” on any UC campus.In a recent comprehensive investigation  of reported incidents of antisemitism – both classic antisemitism and those  instances when classic antisemitic tropes are applied to Israel – at more than  100 US colleges and universities, our organization found that expression  opposing Israel’s right to exist nearly tripled from 2015 to 2016.More than  ever before, in chants at protest rallies, painted on “apartheid walls,” written  in op-eds in the student newspaper, posted on social media and argued in  numerous talks and symposia, Zionism – Israel’s founding ideology – is portrayed  as wholly illegitimate, “solutions” to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that  would eliminate Israel are promoted and open calls for the destruction of Israel  are made.Moreover, schools with Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)  activity were about six times more likely to show evidence of expression  opposing Israel’s right to exist.This is not surprising since virtually  all of the more than 150 active SJP and like-minded student organizations ally  themselves to the BDS movement. After all, the BDS movement’s non-negotiable  demands that Israel end its “occupation and colonization of all Arab lands” and  allow all Palestinian refugees and their descendants – upwards of five million  Arabs – to return to their pre-1948 homes would necessarily result in the  elimination of Israel and its replacement by a Palestinian state. In addition,  each of the BDS movement’s founders and leaders has called for an end to the  Jewish state through violent or non-violent means, and at least one of the  movement’s founding organizations, Hamas, espouses an openly genocidal  anti-Zionism, aspiring not only “to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of  Palestine,” but to murder all of its Jewish inhabitants.Nor is it  surprising that in our study, schools with incidents of expression opposing  Israel’s right to exist were almost three times as likely to show evidence of  blatant anti-Jewish hostility, including assaults and harassment of Jewish  students, destruction of their property, discrimination, and suppression of  Jewish students’ speech. This, too, is consistent with the tenets of  eliminationist anti-Zionism, which targets not only Israel, but also its  presumed supporters, for harmful action.What is surprising, however, is  that despite clear evidence that SJP and similar groups are not simply  criticizing Israeli policy but advocating for Israel’s annihilation, and that  such advocacy frequently leads to actions that target Jewish students for harm,  anti-Israel student groups continue to charge that they are being unfairly  accused of antisemitism.More university leaders must acknowledge that  eliminationist anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism and leads to increased  antisemitism on campus, and commit to addressing it with the same promptness and  vigor as all other forms of bigotry. Barring that acknowledgment and commitment,  Jewish students will remain at risk.

<title>The never-ending walk to freedom</title>
<date>14/4/2016</date>
<content>
Spring has sprung; buds are in bloom; dust is  in the air (in some parts of the world), while snow is melting (in yet others).  These are but harbingers, announcing the approaching culmination of one of the  most significant moments in the history of a people. Year after year, throughout  the world, for centuries, the tale of the flight of the Jewish slaves from  Pharaoh and the people of Egypt who took part in that enslavement is retold.  Families and friends gather to mark the exodus of a people that were held  captive by power and fear, reluctant to challenge reality until it became  unbearable, until hope presented itself, signaling that change is  possible.The crown of the reenactment is a notion that we are told was  as relevant to our ancestors as it is to ourselves, as relevant to Jews as it is  to all others, transcending time and place. We read that “Not just one alone has  arisen against us to destroy us, but in every generation they rise against us to  destroy us” (V’hee she’amda lavoteinu velanu, shelo echad bilvad amad aleinu  lechaloteinu”).




These words, repeated every year, are explained,  discussed and sung, their meanings abundant and implications  tremendous.A possible explanation of the Hebrew verse suggests that when  we are not one, when we stand fragmented and divided, then we can be destroyed.  If this is the case, it follows that rallying around a unifying message, finding  the common thread that binds us together, is the way to secure our continued  existence. This proposed reading offers empowering insights into the development  and evolution of historical processes. Assuming that each individual has a role  to play in the unraveling story, there is meaning to everyday moments, to  life-altering choices and to everything in between.Hindsight is 20/20 as  the saying goes, but what of foresight? What of the personal responsibility and  accountability to genuinely assess current events based on lessons learned from  the past. Assuming that history repeats itself, what of the personal and  collective responsibility and accountability informing present decisions that  impact the future? If the current US election campaign has illustrated anything,  it is that political correctness for the sake of political correctness cannot  replace acquisition of knowledge, opportunities for observation and open  conversation. The current state of affairs in a global reality has clarified  that rose-colored glasses do not in fact alter reality, only its  perception.Candid assessments assert that anti-Semitism has morphed into  anti-Zionism.In a post-politically correct era, it seems probable that  one cannot hope to make progress with leaders who have genocidal aspirations,  openly and regularly declaring their intent to annihilate another state,  Israel.All of the political correctness in the world cannot alter the  implications of such intentions. One cannot hope to truly collaborate with  leaders who deny and distort history, be it the Holocaust, the migration of  hundreds of thousands of post-war refugees or any other historical fact and  figure, in an aim to amend the narrative. No amount of political correctness can  remedy the potential and actual damage caused by the enabling of narratives to  be altered, appropriated or hijacked.Words do in fact have meaning. I  often quote my most important teacher, my father, Prof. Irwin Cotler, who time  and again taught us that the Holocaust did not begin with gas chambers; it began  with words. Whether words relate to the past, the present or the future, their  implications and ramifications reverberate long into the future. The  understanding that only by gathering around one – or The One (there is ample  room for personal choice and belief) – notion, concept, set of values and  beliefs, can we traverse the stormy seas and emerge safely on the opposite  shore, is critical.It is a timely reminder both for those exploiting  current challenges to encourage racist views and for those manipulating reality  to rewrite history. It is a significant reminder for why each and every  individual can and must strive to make a difference, following the brave  examples of individuals such as Raoul Wallenberg; Bishop Chrysostomos and Mayor  Loukas Carrer, both of of Zakynthos, Greece; Capt. Wilm Hosenfeld in  German-occupied Poland, all Righteous Among the Nations.In standing up  to, or ignoring, Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters, who once again, (in an interview  with The Electronic Intifada) accused Israel of being an “apartheid regime,”  individuals like Scarlett Johansson, Bon Jovi and Kevin Costner, are an explicit  current reminder of the role that each and every individual can play in the  never-ending walk to freedom. Time and again along the journey, there are  moments in which we are reminded of the importance of identifying and rallying  around shared values, transcending real or perceived differences.In this  never-ending walk, there are bound to be detours, challenges and obstacles. It  is both overwhelming and empowering to understand that it is not a long walk  that will ultimately get us “there,” but rather a never-ending one.Among  the current challenges encountered along the way, a recent trip to Romania  confirmed the thesis that the BDS campaign is just that – a  campaign.Allowing it to advance its goals by confusing us into mounting  a “counter campaign,” expending valuable resources of every kind, misses the  real imperative of the time – the exposure of this hurdle’s true  goal.BDS is a very real manifestation of the mutated anti-Semitism into  anti-Zionism, gathering sympathizers by manipulating the narrative and abusing  the true meaning of human rights to serve the ultimate goal of delegitimizing  the State of Israel. Incredibly, considering the attention it has received, it  turns out that none of the university students in Romania, and quite possibly in  much of Eastern Europe, ever heard of BDS.In fact, other than a few  professors who travel abroad from time to time, it seemed that no one in Romania  had heard of this rampant, malicious campaign.There are many possible  explanations, among them that human rights did not emerge as the “new religion”  in those countries. Regardless, this highlights the importance of avoiding the  distraction of this pornographic and viral campaign, and reinforces the  imperative to expose what it is a symptom of if we are to continue on the  never-ending journey. It amplifies the significance of addressing the root  causes that have resulted in this campaign, by speaking in a loud and clear  collective voice about the majority of issues that we can agree upon. On the  never-ending walk to freedom, it seems that the spiritual connection to our  personal and collective narrative cannot be disconnected from the physical  one.As we recount the tale of this journey by reading the Haggada,  deepening our understanding from year to year, there is profound hope for  change. Ebbing just below the surface, in an Israeli reality fraught with  violence, challenges and chutzpah, if you listen carefully there is a sense that  the common narrative, loosely bound together by values, is forming and  strengthening. Whereas the founding fathers of Zionism had to leave behind the  divine, wherever they emigrated from, in order to create, build, pave and secure  earthly needs, it seems the time has come to gather the spiritual baggage that  was left behind. Whether in Ethiopia, Iraq, Egypt, Poland or Lithuania, the time  has come to collect the valuables which belong to us all. Though it may be  difficult to discern under the cacophony of all that is Israel, a deeper look  reveals a beautiful process of immigration of the spirit and a return home of  the Jewish soul to the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people.In the  aboriginal language spoken by our forefathers 3,000 years ago, Hebrew; in our  ancestral land, Israel; reading and singing from the same text, the Bible; it  can be heard. If you listen closely, it can be heard in concert halls and in the  music playing on the radio; it can be witnessed in lecture halls and makeshift  rooms buzzing with diverse participants, women and men of every age, ethnicity  and religious affiliation, or no affiliation at all; it can be spotted in daily  human interactions transcending external differences and perceptions. If you  listen carefully, it can be heard, actively reclaiming and modifying the  long-lost treasures of an indigenous people that returned to its ancestral land,  language and book.Understandably, it is not an easy transition, in  particular for those who cast the transcendent aside in order to create and  secure basic survival and viability. The pushback is to be expected. Careful  listening and keen observation, however, indicate that the next generations of  builders are taking the lead in writing the next chapter of the never-ending  walk to freedom.They are doing so in song, study and communication, in  the construction of a colorful, united (as opposed to uniform) sense of  identity. It is the coming to life of the suggested relevant and timely  definition that can be attributed to the ageold adage, which kept our mothers  and fathers and keeps us surviving, for only if we are not united, can we be  destroyed in every generation (“V’hee she’amda lavoteinu velanu, shelo echad  bilvad amad aleinu lechaloteinu”).A final thought. We live in an era in  which science posits that a spiritual foundation is essential for the survival  of the individual. So, too, it seems, spirituality is vital for the endurance of  the collective.This requires a constant striving to transcend real and  perceived differences, committed to shared values and morals, dedicated to their  continued existence. The never-ending walk to freedom is just that, a journey  that fills with a renewed sense of purpose for each and every individual in each  and every generation. Complete freedom is never attained, as that would render  life devoid of meaning. Assuming this is so, we each have a significant role to  play. As you read the words “Next year in Jerusalem the rebuilt,” commit to  ensuring that you and your children can take part in the journey by learning  Hebrew; consider coming to Israel to sense the reality ebbing just below the  surface, in concert and study halls or prime time radio; plan a visit that  includes walking, hiking, biking or running on the land that our ancestors  traversed on the never-ending walk to freedom.The writer grew up in  Canada and Israel, in a universalist, humanist, Canadian, Zionist home.

<title>The revival of British Jewry</title>
<date>26/3/2016</date>
<content>
The surprising news is that British Jewry is in the middle of a revival. Its  numbers are up, younger people are more religiously observant than their  parents, Jewish schools can’t meet the demand for places and Jewish cultural  activities are booming. Anti-Semitism and the threat of terrorism are ever  present, as they are for all Jewish communities, but British Jewry is well  organized, well connected and well prepared to meet the challenges as they  arise.The numbers come from the UK government census.




After  decades of decline, the number of Jews increased, between 2001 and 2011, by some  four percent. The main reason was the growth of the haredi (ultra-Orthodox)  community, but haredim only account for around one in six British Jews. There  was also net migration into the community, from Europe, particularly France, but  also, surprisingly, from Israel. For every two British Jews that made aliya,  three Israelis went the other way.The National Jewish Community Survey,  conducted in 2013, showed that younger Jews are more observant than their  elders. While 28% of those under 40 never travel on Shabbat, the figure drops to  10% for those over 65. In the case of turning on a light on Shabbat, the  respective figures are 26% to 8%.The decline in synagogue membership,  which was sharp in the latter period of the 20th century, has  stabilized.New approaches to prayer organization such as partnership  minyanim and egalitarian services have been moving from the periphery into the  consciousness, if not the buildings, of the Orthodox mainstream.There is  much discussion, perhaps less action, but at the very least a feeling of change  in this most traditional of areas. Jewish schooling continues its fast growth.  Leave aside the haredim where the growth in school numbers simply reflects the  high birth rate and look at the rest of the community, where the birth rate has  been much lower and where any increased demand for Jewish schools reflects a  deliberate choice by parents.In the 15 years to 2010 the number of  non-haredi children in Jewish schools increased by 60%. In areas where a Jewish  school is available more than two-thirds of parents make that choice. Moreover,  the demand continues to rise and community organizations find themselves playing  catch-up trying to increase the supply.Jewish schools have no fees  (besides, ironically, for limudei kodesh or religious studies), but this is not  the reason for the high numbers. Schools have been free since the end of World  War II and the rapid growth has only happened in the past 20 years. The growing  demand is a cultural not a financial phenomenon, caused primarily by: • The  establishment by then chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks of Jewish Continuity and his  haunting question, “Will we still have Jewish grandchildren?” • Growing concern  among parents about falling standards of academic achievement and behavior in  non-Jewish schools.• Official reports together with league tables of  academic performance which placed Jewish schools in the top bracket.•  The demonstration effect or tipping point at which a significant number of  children within any social or synagogue group are attending Jewish  schools.The cultural scene within British Jewry has also improved  dramatically. Limmud is now an international phenomenon, but it began in Britain  and its annual winter conference now attracts over 3,000 eager  participants.JW3 is the new Jewish community cultural center, located in  a prominent site in Hampstead and attracting increasing numbers to its range of  activities.Jewish Book Week now stretches over more than a week, extends  across the community and its events are generally sell-outs, as is the Jewish  Film Festival. Of course not everything is buoyant. Most of the Jewish action is  centered on London where two-thirds of the community live. Another 10% live in  Manchester with its growing haredi influence. But more than 20% of British Jews  live in communities which are declining and aging, some slowly, others more  rapidly. Most are still viable in terms of providing religious services and  kosher food and the larger communities help out the smaller ones. The orderly  management of decline remains a major challenge.And then of course there  is anti-Semitism. Currently the focus is on anti-Semitic attitudes within the  Jeremy Corbyn-led Labor Party, but the community also has to watch closely the  old anti-Semites of the far Right and those on the extreme end of Islam. Jewish  students are continually under pressure whether from boycott resolutions,  anti-apartheid weeks, or meetings being violently attacked. The virulent  anti-Zionism of the cultural elite whether in universities or the media veers  more than occasionally into anti-Semitism and increases fear and anxiety within  the community.But a sense of perspective is also needed. Anti-Semitism  is an existential part of Jewish life. Every community throughout the world has  been subjected to it in varying degrees over the generations. The strength of a  community is not determined by the existence or absence of threats, but by its  ability to recognize those threats and to organize itself to defeat  them.By those criteria the British community is strong.The  Community Security Trust (CST) runs a highly professional and effective  operation with important links with the police and other security agencies. No  communal event secured by CST staff has ever been successfully attacked. Those  in government in Britain have expressed an unequivocal opposition to  anti-Semitism and are taking continuing action to prevent it and to deal harshly  with its perpetrators through legislation and other policies.In the  universities, brave Jewish students confront their opponents and secure  victories in defeating resolutions.All the noise comes from student and  staff societies and has no impact on the policies of the universities  themselves. No UK university has approved an academic boycott of Israel and  there are dozens of examples of academic co-operation between UK and Israeli  universities, including a formal agreement for scientific co-operation signed by  the two governments.Britain has not (yet) had a Charlie Hebdo-style  event, although with high-alert terrorist warnings in effect there is no  guarantee that it won’t happen. If, God forbid, it does, the community’s  resilience will be tested and will not, I believe, be found wanting.The  Israeli response to Diaspora anti-Semitism needs re-thinking. Sometimes, as with  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Paris after the Charlie Hebdo  attack, it can be interpreted as an opportunist attempt to promote aliya. The  sad fact is that currently Jewish lives are more under threat in the Jewish  state than in the Diaspora. Israel and World Jewry need to work together to  neutralize the continuing virus of anti-Semitism.As for British Jewry,  the key question is whether it can sustain its revival. Time alone will  tell.

<title>Time for an Israeli strategy for the next American administration</title>
<date>30/4/2016</date>
<content>
The Palestinians have a strategy that is working. They see they don’t have to make any concessions or even gestures towards Israel, as time is on their side, and no serious consequences for their intransigence are ever imposed.The executive branch, in the name of national security, usually overrides even the periodic withholding of American largess to the PA. The Palestinian leadership knows that the international community, including the United States, is slowly moving each day toward diplomatically isolating Israel.




So if the Palestinians have no incentive to compromise, or stop teaching and inciting violence, does it matter who the next American administration is, or what Israel does? It does matter, and here is why.American support of Israel is NOT inevitable. Israel must begin to think differently, actively show that it is trying to be the partner for peace, and demonstrate that it will manage the situation instead just playing defense.Within the pro-Israel community, there is a palpable sign of relief as the countdown to the end of the contentious eight-year reign of President Obama draws to a close. Much damage could still occur before the clock strikes 2017, as a Presidential parting final blow could occur if he chooses to abstain from a potential one-sided French resolution that would isolate Israel, up-end long-standing international law by supplanting Resolution UNSC 242, and prescribe the creation of a Palestinian State without any of the necessary security assurances to Israel.The eight-year deterioration in the relationship between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the US president also coincided with the creation and meteoric rise of the harshly critical progressive Jewish voice J Street, which captured the imagination of young secular Jews raised on universalism, lacking basic information, and uncritically accepting the Palestinian narrative of ethnic cleansing, genocide, and apartheid.The opinions and advice of J Street resonated in the ideologically sympathetic West Wing, while the iconic mainstream AIPAC organization received administration speakers at its convention, but has had little policy influence in the executive branch.It is hard to remember, but just a few short years ago, only low-level administration officials would even go to a J Street convention, worried that the Democratic Party would be stigmatized by associating with an organization that offered a platform for pro-BDS voices, and left the Israeli side of the story in the shadows.Yet this month, not only did Secretary of State John Kerry attend the J Street national conference, but Vice President Biden, who was the administration speaker at AIPAC, also graced the J Street stage. No clearer snub or moral equivalence could have been telegraphed to the Israeli government and people.Biden, who supposedly had a good working relationship with PM Netanyahu, used the opportunity to trash the prime minister, and make it very clear that this administration holds Israel responsible for the impasse in the peace process. The harshness of the tone surpassed that used by this administration for the world’s bad actors, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, Russia.As Alan Dershowitz said, “This was payback from the White House and Joe Biden was just dead wrong… Netanyahu has offered repeatedly to sit down without preconditions and negotiate peace.To create moral equivalence between Netanyahu and Abbas is to create a false equivalence.”Dershowitz’s correct analysis fell on deaf ears, except with the mainstream and older pro-Israel world.So after the craven Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action deal, Obama’s infamous Cairo speech that linked Israel’s right to exist to the Holocaust, and his fulfilled goal of creating daylight between Israel and the United States, it is no wonder that many people who believe that the US-Israel relationship is beneficial for both nations’ interests are expecting a new day to dawn with whoever is the next American president.And that assessment could be totally wrong.Two years from now, with a President Trump or President Clinton, we may miss Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice, Robert Malley and Obama, who all believe that Israel is a liability worth sidelining to help strengthen Iran against the Sunni world.Yes this rogues’ gallery of Israel bashers who use facts selectively and manipulated Congress during the Iran debate, believe it or not, may seem benign in comparison to what could happen in the next four or eight years. It could be worse – a lot worse.And yes, Israel can and must do something about it.Ben-Dror Yemini, writing in Yediot Aharonot said, “It wouldn’t be a mistake to say that 90 percent of US Jews have a hard time understanding the logic in the continued settlement project. And I’m talking about pro-Israel activists here. We need policy… we need a show of good will… why the heck does the Prime Minister of Israel not understand what Israel’s supporters around the world understand very well? Why does he insist on doing nothing? Why does he insist on helping the BDS movement?” TOO MANY Israeli leaders and American supporters have given up, feeling that it is like banging your head against the wall trying to explain that Israelis want peace, and that the Palestinian Arabs want Israel to not exist. You can state the facts of unreciprocated offers of land for peace by Israel, and the continued propagation of anti-Semitism demonization in the dysfunctional Palestinian society. But without Israeli action, you will continue to be perceived as the stronger party who has the ability to make things right and isn’t doing it.It is time for the Israeli government to show leadership and start to manage the situation, instead of simply reacting to events.The next administration, whether Democratic or Republican may be much less sympathetic to Israel’s fears, and may want to push a peace plan that Israel will be blamed for not accepting.Bibi’s rhetorical skills will not win the day, as he has lost touch with for the need for a more effective American hasbara. Not only are the shekels allocated for foreign policy advocacy woefully inadequate, but also his judgment seems to have been clouded by walking directly into partisan minefields, where other options were available. This was evidenced by his timing of going to Congress last year during an Israeli election cycle to fight against the Iran deal. He simply had to wait until after the Israeli election, and then, if not welcomed as a visiting head of state, the administration would have been blamed for its bias against Israel. Instead, Bibi and Dermer miscalculated and accelerated the divide between pro- and anti-Israel Democrats, while confusing mainstream Americans, who simply needed a better explanation of why Iran was an American national security issue, not just a problem for Israel.Better judgment is needed going forward, and the excuse that Bibi must manage his fragile 61-seat coalition by placating the hard right doesn’t cut it anymore. Israel, for the foreseeable future, needs America diplomatic and security support.The next American president may decide to dictate a solution, pressure Israel as the only party that can be pressured, and an Israeli response that is responsive and defensive could lose the day.If the next president is a Democrat, you will hear growing calls for a balanced “even-handed” approach to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The Bernie Sanders Democrats are on the ascendancy, and will be casting a large shadow on the party for the next generation.In today’s progressive parlance, even-handed does not necessarily mean support for two states for two peoples.Rather, it means to many of the “Palestinian Lives Matter” Democrats, two Palestinian states – one in what now comprises Israel within the 1949 armistice line, and one in the West Bank and Gaza. Too many well-meaning people have been hijacked by the BDS movement, being misled into believing that if Israel just left the West Bank, peace would break out. Nothing could be farther from the truth.Far too many in the Democratic Party now define Zionism by the terms of the anti-Zionists, challenging Israel’s right to exist, and defining it by the policies of the current democratically elected government. Does Israel have a right to exist only if it elects a Labor government? Does America only have a right to exist if it is lead by only one particular party and viewpoint? As for a possible Trump presidency, who knows? His egocentricity may actually make him believe that only he can solve this unsolvable conflict, and he may try to force a solution upon Israel.He has already said that Israel should pay back all the money America has given Israel over the years. Serious pressure is a real possibility. If Israel for good reasons turns him down, he is certainly unpredictable, and he could lash out by a creating rupture in the relationship worse than Obama’s.So what to do? Take to the offensive, put some plans down on the table as soon as there is a new administration, work with them, and then actively manage the situation and expectations.Some ideas: Announce a readiness for an Israeli settlement freeze beyond the land swap areas (6%) in exchange for Palestinian, Arab League, UN recognition of a Jewish State as envisioned by UNGA Resolution 181, the end of the right of return, and acceptance of a totally demilitarized Judea and Samaria. Offer conditional recognition of a Palestinian state for a signed end of conflict agreement.Consider convening an Israeli summit of the nation’s security and military leaders, past and present, to discuss the maximum land offer to the Palestinians that won’t endanger Israeli security interests. Put Bogie Ya’alon in charge, as he is one of the very few members of the government respected by much of the opposition. Other than the Jordan River Valley and the settlement blocs, there is much to discuss that would not endanger Israel.Coordinate right from the beginning with the new administration and convince them that your offers are a basis for talks, and let them become your advocates. Go directly to the American people and make your case, with the help of bipartisan pro-Israel Congressional spokesmen.As for the basket case of Hamas’ Gaza, offer a seaport in exchange for demilitarization with acceptance of all previous agreements. It won’t happen, but it may smooth the way for the Turkish-Israeli rapprochement that both nations need and want.These conciliatory steps are all conditional; nothing will be given up if the Palestinians remain intransigent or if Israeli security is seen to be compromised.The Palestinian Authority in all likelihood would not accept any of this, but that is not the point. The goal is to change the dynamic going forward, putting Israel on the diplomatic offensive to blunt the pro-BDS movement, and create a situation for an improved relationship with the American people, who do not understand why Israel is building in communities in the West Bank. America should simultaneously pressure the Gulf Cooperation Council to move towards a more public relationship with Israel, as Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and Morocco now have.Israel must invest time and resources into explaining to the American people the difference between communities in areas like Gush Etzion and Ma’aleh Adumim, and those in far-flung locations in Area C, even though Obama’s strategy to delegitimize all Israeli building over the 1949 armistice line has all but poisoned reasonable compromises, and made the Palestinian leadership even more intransigent.The goal is to make the next administration embrace an Israel that is seen as the one who is making the painful compromises for a lasting peace, which could consume the next 10 years. This may be the best that one can hope for.A Democratic or Republican administration in 2017 will remain tilted to the Israeli perspective with reasonable offers to the Palestinians even if unreciprocated, especially if the PA remains as stubborn, undemocratic and unwilling to accept any Jewish state as they are today.

<title>To beat boycotts, embrace the millennials</title>
<date>12/7/2016</date>
<content>
Israel and its friends and supporters, particularly in the US, have become increasingly concerned with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on university campuses.To win the ideological war being waged on US campuses by BDS that today intersects with classic anti-Semitism and terrorist-supporting campus organizations, Israeli and Jewish leadership needs to understand and embrace the ideological, moral and intellectual milieu of the millennial student population whose support for Israel hangs in the balance.




“Root for the underdog” – this has been the axiom of progressives for decades; fight for the oppressed, fight for the minority, fight for the underprivileged. For a movement that fought for women’s rights, gay rights, civil rights and the end of the South African apartheid, the emergence of BDS on the US university campus is a seemingly natural progression.BDS has found a breeding ground inside the gates of the US university. These institutions of higher learning have become the ideological incubators of leftist ideology and the intellectual home of the progressive leaders of tomorrow. For the current generation of US university millennials, Israel is a tough sell even on a good day.Unlike earlier generations for which anti-Semitism, the Holocaust and Arab state aggression made Israel morally infallible, in the “millennial mind” Israel is perceived as “Israel the militarily impenetrable” and “Israel the largest recipient of US foreign and military aid” – making the Jewish state ripe for critique by this generation’s “free thinking” millennials.Israel’s expression of strength has been required to deter and defeat the enemies crouching at its doorstep – Hezbollah, Iran, Hamas, PLO groups and Salafi jihadists to name a few. But in projecting power, Israel has paid a price among millions of millennials in the West who ideologically de-identify with power and more closely empathize with its “victims” – the underdogs – whom many millennials see as the weak and vulnerable.In the minds of millennials and other progressive thinkers, Israel’s current status as a military and economic superpower has vindicated their perception of “Israel the bully.” The verdict of Israel as “the heavy” with regard to the Palestinian- Israeli conflict has pushed millennials and other young leftists into blindly following the BDS battle cry.Universities have become fertile grounds for garnering the liberal-progressive condemnation of “Israel the apartheid state” denying justice to the Palestinians. The BDS leadership has exploited this opportunity. In contrast to pro-Israel supporters on campus, the BDS leadership has been particularly successful in pandering to millennial values; feelings over facts, weakness over strength and cultural relativism over a universal moral standard.BDS assertiveness, coupled with the cultural and moral relativism that define millennials, has resulted in major student and faculty support for the Palestinian narrative, particularly that of Hamas. BDS events on hundreds of US universities commonly feature the common Palestinian rallying cry “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which essentially calls for Israel’s destruction.And it seems that the pro-BDS campus crusaders are winning. According to the AMCHA Initiative, there was an increase of 31.2 percent in anti-Israel activity in 2014 to 2015 alone.While pro-Israel groups have been working on campus to counter BDS success, they lack a unified front and effective counter-narrative. More significantly, they seem to be missing a conceptual understanding of the cultural and psychological dispositions of those students and faculty they are seeking to influence.Jewish and pro-Israel organizations have been essentially reactive, rushing to the aid and defense of Jewish students and pro-Israel supporters when waves of BDS-led anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist offensives break out.BDS leaders on the other hand have been far more proactive; they have forged a consistent core message across US campuses. They have established satellite BDS chapters on campuses across the US and effectively allied with other human rights organizations thereby leveraging their influence; all while working to achieve their primarily goal – to rally millennials in their crusade against Israel.BDS has created a strategic disconnect on the university campus between its purported aims of “fighting for the underdog” and its true intentions of delegitimizing and ultimately destroying Israel.Under the guise of the progressive “free thinking” agenda in the pursuit of justice for the Palestinians, BDS has gained legitimacy and support from the US millennial generation, recruiting even some American left-wing Jews into accepting their radical narrative.Israel and its supporters must use an “expose and embrace” strategy to win hearts and minds of millennials on US campuses. They must expose BDS for what it is in a context and language that is relevant to millennials.BDS is not a grassroots movement; its is not a movement of so-called “free thinkers” nor is it meant to bring “justice” and “liberation” to the Palestinians. Rather BDS is a tyrannical movement that has successfully imprisoned traditionally “free thinking” millennials into a moral and intellectual solitary confinement that has barred them from an evaluation of the facts, the context and the complexities of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.To embrace millennials, Israel must reveal its true self to the world in a language and context that resonates. Israel is the one and only country in the Middle East where Palestinian men and women citizens can become senior government ministers, leading legislators and supreme court justices. Its the only nation-state in the region where Jewish, Christian and Muslim citizens receive the same equal and legally guaranteed benefits. And its the only place in the Middle East where two men or two woman can walk down the street holding hands without fear and protected under law.Once it is exposed that BDS does not work to bring these rights to a prospective Palestinian state, but works only to delegitimize the one country in the region that protects them, millennials will rally against BDS.The author is currently enrolled in the dual BA program at Sciences Po in Paris and Columbia University.

<title>Troubled water</title>
<date>27/7/2016</date>
<content>
The latest skirmish in the war of the Jews was won this week by the forces of  uncompromising ultra-Orthodoxy, which passed the so-called “Mikve Law”  disenfranchising non-Orthodox Jews. But it will be seen as a Pyrrhic victory,  destined eventually to be overturned by the High Court of Justice as  unconstitutional.The Mikve Law is but the latest attempt by  fundamentalists to deny the Jewish identity of other streams of  Judaism.




Since the law was specifically designed to ban the non-Orthodox  from using public mikvaot, funded by Israel’s taxpayers, for use in concluding  the process of converting to Judaism, it must be seen in the context of the “Who  is a Jew” dispute that has waxed and waned over the decades.For behind  the refusal to permit newly Jewish acolytes to complete their conversion in a  ritual bath, is the fundamental denial of their Jewishness. The question of “Who  is a Jew” has become focused on “What is a mikve.” In February the Supreme Court  ruled that a publicly funded ritual bath must be accessible by all who wish to  use it.The situation is similar to the still-suspended agreement over  public access to the Western Wall prayer areas – both traditional Orthodox and  egalitarian – whose implementation has been held up by the ultra-Orthodox view  that recognizing a common entrance to the site would constitute recognition of  the Reform and Conservative movements.Setting aside the differences in  conversion practices in the Diaspora, which are mostly accepted here, the denial  of access to the Western Wall is part of the denial of the non-Orthodox per se.  Prohibiting non-Orthodox converts access to public mikvaot is to deny them  access to Judaism itself and contradicts the basic values of our  heritage.Moreover, the present round of intolerance highlights the basic  inconsistency of Orthodox conversion. Under the Chief Rabbinate, Jews are  fundamentally unequal. While a person born to a Jewish mother is considered to  be a Jew and may grow up being religiously observant or secular by choice, in  Israel a person can convert only as a declared Orthodox Jew – and even risks  being defrocked if found to be less than strictly observant.At a time  when Israel is fighting internationally against the calumnies of the BDS  movement, particularly its specious accusations of apartheid, our politicians  from so-called religious parties have scored an own-goal. BDS adherents may  expect signs being posted at the Western Wall and the country’s mikvaot reading  “Orthodox Only” and “No Non-Orthodox Allowed.”Part of the Mikve Law’s  attempt to bypass the Supreme Court’s decision was the apartheid-like idea to  have the government establish several “separate but unequal” mikvaot for the  progressive Jewish movements. If this is ever implemented, it will inevitably  result in another High Court petition for equality.It would be a mistake  to think that the Mikve Law and the Western Wall situation is a parochial, local  affair that does not affect Diaspora Jewry, particularly American  Jews.Indeed, they are well informed of every development in Israel,  especially the ongoing struggle for the recognition of progressive streams of  Judaism in Israel.This struggle is an uphill battle against a vile  combination of political blackmail and religious intolerance, as embodied by the  chairman of the United Torah Judaism Party, Health Minister Ya’acov Litzman. He  blatantly declared on Israel Radio that his party would not stay in a government  that recognizes the Reform and Conservative movements.Litzman cynically  bet that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would choose political survival based  on his alliance with the haredi parties over his pious promises to make Israel a  home for all Jews. Just in case Diaspora Jews were listening, Litzman declared:  “The Reform don’t know what mikvaot are. They are jacuzzis for them,” he  said.Yizhar Hess, director of the Masorti (Conservative Movement) in  Israel, condemned Litzman’s denigration of the non-Orthodox, telling The  Jerusalem Post, “It’s a strategic threat to the State of Israel as the state of  the Jewish people.”The threats have grown over the past months, such as  with the rollback of laws ensuring an equal burden of military service,  providing a core curriculum (math and English) for yeshiva education, and now  denying access to public mikvaot to the non-Orthodox.Israel has a long  way to go to fulfill the promise of religious equality heralded in our  Declaration of Independence.
Our goal must be nothing less than to  guarantee a citizen’s right to worship as he or she sees fit, free from the  interference of the state.

<title>UN appointments process violates professional and ethical standards</title>
<date>23/3/2016</date>
<content>
In the next two weeks, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) will  select a new Special Rapporteur on the “situation of human rights in the  Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.” This job, created “to investigate  Israel’s violations of the principles and bases of international law,” is an  integral part of the systematic bias toward Israel that plagues almost every  corner of the UN. While there are Rapporteurs examining situations in other  countries, the Rapporteur for the Palestinians, established in 1993, is the only  position that never expires. Moreover, despite the deceptive title, the mandate  itself is expressly one-sided – only Israel is to be pilloried, while the  actions of Palestinians are excluded from scrutiny.




As documented by UN  Watch, the group’s first choice, Penelope Green from the UK, and second choice  Michael Lynk of Canada, both have extensive histories in anti-Israel activism  and promoting BDS (boycotts, divestment and sanctions). Even more disturbing,  both candidates have expressed highly troubling sentiments about  terrorism.If the UN were a respectable and responsible institution,  Green and Lynk would have been immediately disqualified from consideration. One  of the cornerstones of human rights monitoring and credible fact finding is a  commitment to impartiality.According to scholars Thomas Franck and Scott  Fairley, impartiality is “functional prerequisite,” without which fact-finding  can only be seen as “propaganda” used to “support generally per-conceived  political views.” Similarly, the International Bar Association’s Lund London  Guidelines on fact-finding require objectivity and “individuals who are and are  seen to be unbiased.”Professor Frederic Magret notes that expressions of  polemics and activism all weigh against impartiality.Even the UN’s own  candidate selection criteria require as of “paramount importance” impartiality  and objectivity.Apparently, though, when it comes to Israel, the UNHRC  and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which  facilitates the appointment process, feel unbound by these  rules.Instead, anti-Israel bias and politicization are the most  important qualifications for a job relating to the conflict, outweighing  commitment to institutional requirements, fairness, due process and other human  rights and good governance principles.The recommendation of Green and  Lynk for the Rapporteur position is not an isolated incident.In 2001,  the Commission on Human Rights (predecessor to the UNHRC, disbanded in 2006 for  extreme politicization and bias) appointed South African lawyer John Dugard as  Rapporteur. Dugard has long been a leading figurehead of the BDS movement  including promoting the “apartheid” canard. In an interview with Democracy Now,  Dugard pronounced he had “no hesitation in saying that Israel’s crimes are  infinitely worse than those committed by the apartheid regime of South Africa.”  In 2004, in calling for his dismissal, the ADL remarked that Dugard was “using  his official position as a UN fact-finder to present his personal anti-Israel  views.”Dugard’s replacement was the equally prejudiced Richard Falk.  Falk promotes an immoral so-called “right to resistance,” which essentially  excuses Palestinian terrorism. Falk’s inflammatory rhetoric includes accusing  Israel of having “genocidal intentions” toward the Palestinians. He used his  position at the UN to advance BDS and the international isolation of  Israel.He also distinguished himself by being rebuked by UN Secretary  General Ban Ki-moon after making 9/11 “truther” comments. The US and Canada  demanded his resignation after he posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his  blog.Institutional bias at the UNHRC also means that highly qualified  individuals without anti-Israel animus are routinely passed in favor of radical  ideologues and demagogues.In 2014, Christina Cerna, a well-respected  expert and former member of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,  applied to replace Falk and was considered to be the leading candidate. Yet, she  eventually was rejected for not being sufficiently anti-Israel.Cerna  remarked, in the aftermath, that when it comes to Israel, “[i]mpartiality is not  a requirement sought by the Council.” She further noted that “the Organization  of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States both officially opposed  me... because I had never said anything pro-Palestinian and consequently was not  known to be ‘partial.’” Cerna applied again in 2016, only to be passed over in  favor of Green and Lynk, confirming her pointed critique.To be sure, the  UNHRC’s problems go far beyond the pathological anti-Semitism and dysfunctional  Israel obsession of the Arab League and the OIC, or the dominating voices of  corrupt and repressive regimes at the UN.This year’s committee to choose  the rapporteurs included France, Thailand, Albania and Brazil. The OHCHR also  plays a major role in guiding the selection process, and later will write the  Rapporteur’s anti-Israel reports and statements.At some point, one hopes  that the UNHRC and the countries and officials that enable its abuse of ethics  and rules will decide that universal principles are more important than  politicization and ideology.If the UNHRC, the OHCHR and the UN as a  whole wanted to prove that they really care about human rights, rather than its  exploitation, they should strive to appoint as Rapporteur individuals who are  objective and impartial. They should also expand the Rapporteur’s mandate to  include examination of violations by all actors in the Palestinian  conflict.
And, most importantly, they should abide by their commitments  to the principles that are meant to guide the workings of the UN.

<title>‘Understanding’ murder</title>
<date>13/1/2016</date>
<content>
Is there a source anywhere in Christian doctrine that condones turning a blind  eye to murder? Don’t practicing Christians unequivocally uphold the Sixth  Commandment of the Decalogue, “You shall not murder,” with even a greater  stringency than Jews by interpreting the Hebrew as “You shall not kill?” It  appears that some professing Christians have nonetheless succeeded in  establishing a gray area within the meaning of this precept, carving out some  moral wiggle room, as it were.Having chosen the Palestinian narrative  over Israel’s in the Middle East’s seemingly most interminable conflict, a  number of liberal, mainline Christian churches view the now nearly daily attacks  with intent to murder Israelis as an unfortunate but “understandable” response  to the “occupation.”




This language continues to emerge in discussions I  have held recently with a number of Christian activist groups from North America  and Europe who have come to this region on fact-finding tours and to demonstrate  their solidarity with Palestinian Arabs. These are among the hundreds of  church-sponsored groups that throughout the year visit this contentious area  purportedly in search of social justice and peace, though their vision of peace  requires concessions only from the State of Israel.When the topic of the  ongoing stoning, knifings, shootings and car rammings arises, as these days it  inevitably must, speakers from these different groups regularly preface their  remarks with a declaration condemning “all acts of violence and terrorism,” to  which they dutifully add three words: “from both sides.”This carefully  constructed example of lip service that echoes familiar official statements from  White House and US State Department spokesmen establishes that Israelis and  Palestinians are equally responsible for the current violence. Following this  platitude comes an ambiguous coda: “While we don’t approve of the [Palestinian]  violence, we understand it.”They “understand” it.How is the word  “understand” to be understood here? To understand in this context could simply  mean to acknowledge the circumstances.These circumstances are that  Palestinians view themselves as an occupied people with no satisfactory  political horizon, no way out. Israel is the occupier. The violent behavior and  acts of terrorism directed by some Palestinians at Israelis are therefore but a  logical expression of their frustration, a way of letting off steam; a simple  case of cause and effect.Palestinian frustration that leads to violence  is understandable, these activists assert, given that Israel: • Prevents  Palestinian freedom of movement throughout the West Bank • Continues to steal  Palestinian land for the ongoing building and expansion of illegal settlements •  Limits Palestinian access to water • Has a policy of humiliating Palestinians •  Shoots and jails Palestinian children • Practices apartheid • Is a police state  • Does to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews • Is guilty of  genocide Each of these unfounded and outlandish allegations has been voiced in  my presence, sometimes individually, sometimes in combination, by Christian  groups. It is at this stage, when the charge sheet against Israel is vocalized,  that what I believe to be the underlying significance of “we understand the  violence” becomes clear.The strong feelings behind these grievances are  evident in the tone, facial expressions and even the gesticulations of the  speakers.The passion, indeed the anger in their voices, exposes just how  much more than a simple descriptive account of “cause and effect” is the phrase  “we understand the violence.” Implicit in these words is the intimation of  acceptance, even justification. What they are saying is “Israelis have it coming  to them.”These groups of Christians appear to have lost touch with some  of their faith’s most fundamental teachings. The Gospel of Matthew preaches  non-violence, compassion and non-retaliation. These are traits that Christians  are called upon to emulate. However, their commitment to social justice,  seasoned by their frustration and anger at what they believe to be Israel’s  callous treatment of Palestinians, has ironically brought them to accepting  low-grade, “lone wolf” terrorism as a morally challenging but de facto  legitimate political expression.This attitude does not exist within a  vacuum and is hardly confined to such liberal Christian activists; their views  reflect the wider zeitgeist.International news media have opted to  generally ignore the drama of daily terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists on  Israel’s citizens.With few exceptions, such as the recent shooting  murders in Tel Aviv, this continues to be the case. Why are these terrorist  attacks and the stress they are putting on Israeli society deemed hardly  newsworthy? Why has there been virtually no condemnation of the steady stabbings  and car rammings voiced by news editors, heads of state, church leaders,  academicians, intellectuals, artists, celebrities and other opinion shapers? Is  it because Palestinians are behaving the way the world expects them to behave,  or is it because a few Israelis being stabbed, shot, or run over each day is  considered tolerable? The collective wisdom of most Western news media assigns  responsibility for the protracted haplessness of the Palestinian Arabs to  Israel, rather than to the corrupt and lawless kleptocracy known as the  Palestinian Authority or the indifferent Arab world. Watchdog websites CAMERA  and Honest Reporting demonstrate this preconception through myriad examples of  reportage and op-eds that continue to portray Israel as a brutish military power  intent on controlling the lives and crushing the spirits of Palestinian  Arabs.Therefore it comes as no surprise, say critics of the Jewish  state, that many Palestinian Arabs, particularly the youth, having been provoked  naturally respond with violence.The violence, in its current form, still  limited to mostly “small acts of terrorism” such as stabbings and car rammings,  may even be considered normative. Normative is not newsworthy.Compare  these circumstances to recent events in Paris and San Bernardino. To Western  commentators there is no doubt that those terrorist attacks were unprovoked and  visited upon unsuspecting innocents.Those acts were unexpected and  shocking, and therefore, in contrast to Israel, newsworthy.Christian  pro-Palestinian activists regularly contend that the Western news media carry a  pro-Israel bias. If this was true, this latest wave of terrorism would not go  virtually unmentioned. The dearth of media attention lends credence to the idea  that what is going on in the streets of Israel is viewed as just not that big a  deal. Charlie Hebdo editor Gerard Biard writes recently that no one questions  when Jews are killed because they are Jewish. How much truer is this observation  when the murdered Jews are Israelis? The media bias contributes to an atmosphere  in which otherwise moral people, decent people, who hurt for the Palestinian  Arabs, hesitate to openly criticize this terrorism.Their hesitation is a  signal of their sanction.There is a price that these Christian activists  pay for this reticence. They talk of peace but they will never help bring peace  to this region. Their reluctance to loudly and wholeheartedly denounce all acts  of Palestinian terrorism and incitement, at least at the same level at which  they condemn Israel’s policies, excludes them from assuming a constructive role.  They are not fit to help facilitate reconciliation between the conflicting  parties. Their leniency in judging the trespasses of Palestinian terrorists  disqualifies them from taking their place at the table. It is insufficient for  these liberal Christians to “understand” the murder; they must openly condemn  it, not in effect condone it.

<title>Walter Rathenau, Theodor Lessing and Jewish self-hatred</title>
<date>9/2/2016</date>
<content>
Do the Irish despise themselves? Are Italians embarrassed by their grand  history? Why are Iranians, who should be ashamed of being the world’s primary  state sponsor of global terrorism, so proud of their past? While I cannot gain  the proper insight to answer these questions, not being the product of these  cultures and societies, I am the son of a people – the Jewish people – that seem  to be embarrassed of who they are, ignorant of a history that they condemn, and  who vilify the Jewish state that represents the hope of Jewish sovereignty in  the Land of Israel for which Jews prayed for 2,000 years.Was there  Jewish self-hatred in the ancient and medieval world? The honest answer is that  there were some Jews who abandoned Judaism for paganism or who converted to  Christianity and Islam. In 1492, rather than face exile 50,000 Jews converted to  Catholicism – but 100,000 Jews chose to hold on to their Jewish identity and  left Spain for the dangers of the roads and high seas because they could never  imagine abandoning a Judaism they so valued.




Jewish self-hatred and  feelings of inferiority are a modern phenomenon.The modern Jew lacks the  “superiority complex” of his ancestor and no longer embraces the central concept  of a “Chosen People.” The European Enlightenment drummed into Jews feelings of  inferiority – Judaism was primitive, tribal and devoid of ethics, the  Enlightenment thinkers said, as a Religion of Revelation that stood in stark  contrast to Christianity as the superior Religion of Reason.With the  granting of emancipation and citizenship to Jews, the idea of a Jewish nation  and people was wiped away and Jews had to bend over backward to prove their  loyalty to their new fatherlands. Heinrich Heine, the great German poet of the  19th century, born a Jew but who abandoned Judaism for Lutheranism, claimed the  only reason he converted was because Christianity was “the entrance ticket to  Western Civilization.” Obviously, for Heine and many other Jews, Judaism was an  embarrassment and an obstacle. Even the rise of modern Zionism did not erase  this self-hatred.While the visionaries of the Zionist movement restored  Jewish pride and provided a bulwark against assimilation, the attitude toward  2,000 years of Jewish life in the Diaspora was negative and viewed as a story of  suffering, persecution and woe. This was only a partial truth. Economic success,  literary achievement and religious creativity were all central to the Jewish  experience in Exile.In my 19 years of teaching Jewish history in adult  education programs throughout South Florida, I have come to rely upon one book.  The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History is a collection of primary  sources from the modern Jewish world, edited by professors Paul Mendes-Flohr and  Jehuda Reinharz. On the subject of modern Jewish self-hatred, I found two  documents in this collection that stand in startling contrast. The first is  “Hear, O Israel” published in Germany in 1897. It was the work of Walter  Rathenau, a prominent industrialist and statesman – and a Jew.Rathenau’s  critique of German Jews is devastating and was even used by anti-Semites in  Germany as an effective polemical tool against the Jews.Rathenau later  withdrew the essay from his collected writings because it was so  caustic.While Rathenau rejected conversion as the answer to the  rejection of German Jews by Christians, he proposes “the conscious  self-education and adaptation of the Jews to the expectations of the Gentiles.”  His words to German Jews are devastating: “Look at yourselves in the mirror!  This is the first step toward self-criticism.Nothing, unfortunately, can  be done about the fact that all of you look frighteningly alike and that your  individual vices, therefore, are attributed to all of you...As soon as you have  recognized your unathletic build, your narrow shoulders, your clumsy feet, your  sloppy roundish shape, you will resolve to dedicate a few generations to the  renewal of your outer appearance.”Rathenau continues – “I do not know  what the people of Israel looked like in Palestine – their contemporaries do not  seem to share their beauty – but two thousand years of misery cannot but leave  marks too deep to be washed away by eau de cologne.”While Zionist leader  Max Nordau’s call a few years later for a “Jewry of muscle” echoes some of  Rathenau’s criticism, these two Jews come to totally different conclusions.  Rathenau called for Jews to assimilate and ape Gentile society. Nordau called  for the emergence of a proud and physically fit Jew who would transcend  assimilation.Standing in contrast to Rathenau’s mocking of the central  credo of Jewish faith and the prayer of martyrs that were the title of his  essay, his contemporary, German-Jewish philosopher Theodor Lessing, explored the  sort of self-hatred epitomized by Rathenau’s call for Jews to shed their  embarrassing values and appearance.While a student, Lessing converted to  Christianity but later returned to Judaism and embraced Zionism. His classic  work, Jewish Self-Hatred, published in 1930, explored the psychology of Jewish  intellectuals who rejected their Jewish roots and despised their origins.  Lessing asks: “We all love to use the beautiful phrase: ‘Happy is he who gladly  remembers his forefathers.’ But what is left for a child who must turn away in  shame from his forefathers because they have played their irresponsible games  with energies peculiar to their race and have thrown him, the grandchild, into  the world as though he were an accident? Such a child, surrounded by a base and  unsatisfactory environment, spends his feeble answers on a hateful tearing  against unbreakable chains.”Lessing called upon Jews to free themselves  from their oppressive legacy and not to betray their fate. As Rathenau cried out  for Jews to look in the mirror and shed their Jewishness, Lessing calls out with  a very different message: “Be firm! You will surely endure your personal hell  and attain deliverance in your true self in your eternal people.” For Lessing,  the return of Jews to the Land of Israel was a harbinger of Jewish renewal and  the end of an unnatural life in Europe that led to self-hatred.It is an  irony that Rathenau and Lessing met similar ends. As foreign minister of Germany  in the post- WWI Weimar government, Rathenau was assassinated as a “Jewish  swine” by extremists from the Right in 1922.
Lessing was murdered by Nazi  agents in Czechoslovakia in 1933. Almost a century later, their debate is alive  and well as young Jews flock to the anti-Israel boycott movement in America and  Europe and Jewish intellectuals label Israel an “apartheid state” and equate  Jewish soldiers in the IDF with Nazis. The post-Zionists who libel Israel by  claiming the State of Israel was founded in the “original sin” of genocide and  imperialism are also self-haters. As has been said often, Jews are sometimes  their own worst enemies. Our great heritage is being squandered and rejected by  Jews who despise their roots and their identity, a glorious past and a thriving  present that should be celebrated

<title>WASHINGTON WATCH: When yes means no</title>
<date>4/5/2016</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week unequivocally rejected the French  proposal for a Middle East peace conference involving some two dozen nations to  be held in Paris this summer. He said the only way to resolve the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict is by “direct bilateral negotiations.”He’s  right.




And he declared he is “ready immediately to begin direct  negotiations with the Palestinians without any preconditions.”He’s just  kidding.He says that all the time, but he doesn’t really mean  it.He has more preconditions than Donald Trump has prenups with his  several wives.He says he supports the two-state solution.That’s  even funnier.The French have invited the Middle East Quartet (United  States, Russia, the European Union, the United Nations), the Arab League, and  some 20 foreign ministers to Paris on May 30 to set the agenda for the summer  conference, but the Israelis and Palestinians were told to stay home.At  this writing, the United States has not accepted the invitation, but it is hard  to imagine Secretary of State John Kerry staying away since he’s about the only  one in the Obama administration who still believes in the peace  process.The purpose of the conference is to revive negotiations for a  two-state solution.Since Netanyahu announced his support for the concept  at Bar Ilan University in 2009 he has not once asked his coalition, not even his  inner cabinet or his own Likud Party, to endorse the policy. And despite calling  for negotiations without preconditions he has been piling on the conditions,  some valid and others simply designed to elicit Palestinian  rejection.Netanyahu speaks in Washington and in foreign capitals about  the two-state solution, but 14 months ago during elections he promised voters  there would be no Palestinian state on his watch. In the wake of international  criticism, he tried to walk that back after the election, but President Barack  Obama and most world leaders weren’t buying it, especially when Netanyahu  proceeded to form the most right-wing coalition in Israeli history, heavily  weighted with ultra-nationalists and religious extremists opposed to Palestinian  statehood.The Palestinians want to make east Jerusalem the capital of  their new state, but Netanyahu adamantly opposes any division of the city. He  demands the Palestinians recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people,  a condition many Israeli analysts consider a deliberate deal breaker. He also  wants a long-term Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley and that the  new state should be demilitarized.Years of negotiations have shown many  of the differences can be worked out – refugees, border swaps, security  cooperation – when the two sides are ready to make peace.American and  other diplomats who’ve participated in earlier talks say both sides have made  “drastic concessions” on some core issues.However, Netanyahu insists  that nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. That’s part of what he  means by “no preconditions.” Starting each new round at square one is another  stalling tactic.The Palestinians have their own preconditions for talks,  starting with a demand that Israel accept their terms on core issues in  advance.Publicly the Palestinians insist on full right of return for  refugees and their descendants displaced after 1948, but privately they’ve  indicated considerable flexibility. The US and Israel insist that Palestinian  refugees should go to the Palestinian state and Jewish refugees to the Jewish  state.Both sides have their own poison pills they know are unacceptable  to the other. What they’re really looking for is not a path to peace but a way  to divert blame for failure.Abbas also poisons the atmosphere for talks  when he accuses Israel of “Judaizing” Jerusalem, denies Jewish ties to the city  and the existence of the Temples, accuses Israel of war crimes, mounts attacks  in international agencies and honors those who murder Jews as martyrs and  heroes.Each leader complains that he has no partner for peace, and he’s  right.President Obama believes “Netanyahu has no political courage and  won’t take risks to bring about a two-state solution,” Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in  The Atlantic after extensive White House interviews. The president sees  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas as “sincere” about wanting peace  but too “weak, ineffective and uncreative” to make a deal, Goldberg  noted.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Israel’s closest European ally,  believes Netanyahu has no intention of making peace and his settlement policy  will render a two-state solution impossible while leading Israel into becoming  an apartheid state, according to Der Spiegel magazine.The French are  pressing for the international conference because they and other Europeans fear  that the lone-wolf stabbings of Israelis by Palestinians reflects a growing  frustration with the stagnation of the peace process and that could spark a new  and more violent intifada. This one would not just be against Israel but also  the moribund Abbas administration.The French have another motivation.  They see a power vacuum and want to fill it. Historically the US has dominated  the efforts to broker peace between Israel and its neighbors, but the Obama  administration has largely written off any chance for progress not only during  its remaining nine months in office but as long as Netanyahu and Abbas remain in  power.The Netanyahu government is fearful of Europe, Russia and the UN  filling a void it helped create with its obstructionist policies. Israel’s UN  ambassador, Danny Danon, has said he is trying to persuade as many countries as  possible to avoid the Paris meeting later this month. He said Israel fears the  summit is part of a campaign to impose a two-state settlement on it. A  settlement which Danon adamantly opposes.
Next month marks the beginning  of the 50th year of the occupation and peace seems as elusive as ever.

<title>Whom do bigots blame for police shootings in America? Israel, of course!</title>
<date>14/7/2016</date>
<content>
In response to the tragic deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling at the  hands of police officers in Minnesota and Louisiana, respectively, the New York  University Chapter of the Students for Justice in Palestine (“SJP”) tweeted the  following: “In the past 48 hours another two black men have been lynched by the  police.... We must remember that many US police departments train with  
IsraeliDefenceForces. The same forces behind the genocide of black people in  America are behind the genocide of Palestinians. What this means is that  Palestinians must stand with our black comrades. We must struggle for their  liberation. It is as important as our own. 
Alton- Sterling is as important as  
Ali- Dawabsheh. Palestinian liberation and black liberation go together. We  must recognize this and commit to building for it.”Even in moments of  national mourning such as these, SJP bigots cannot help but exploit the deaths  of innocent Americans to further their own anti-Semitic political agenda, namely  to delegitimize and demonize the nation state of the Jewish people.




By  implicating Israel in these killings, the SJP is engaging in the old trope of  blaming Jews for systemic and far-reaching societal problems.This  practice was anti-Semitic when some Christian communities used it to blame Jews  for plagues, poisonings and murders; it was anti-Semitic when the Nazis used it  to blame Jews for the failing German economy; and it is still anti-Semitic  today. There is no more evidence that any of the police who killed Mr. Castile  and Mr.Sterling were trained in Israel than there was that Jews were  responsible for any of the other crimes that formed the basis for traditional  blood libels.The oppression of black Americans long predates the  founding of the State of Israel; contrary to the claims of the SJP and  like-minded groups, Zionism did not beget racism, nor is Zionism a reflection of  racism. It is the national liberation movement of the Jewish people. But the  twisted logic on the part of the SJP should come as no surprise, given that the  same organization blamed Zionism for rising tuition costs in the City University  of New York college system.The essence of anti-Semitism is the bigoted  claim that if there is a problem, then Jews – and now Zionists – must be its  cause.Addressing the structural causes of racism in the United States  will take more than scapegoating Israel – it will require the type of  far-reaching legislative action of which our current Congress seems  incapable.By morphing the discussion about criminal justice reform and  systemic racism in the United States into a polemic against Israel, the SJP  makes progress even more difficult.That said, the reaction by the SJP is  reflective of a broader trend in hardleft politics. Increasingly, groups such as  Black Lives Matter, MoveOn, Code Pink and Occupy Wall Street have embraced  intersectionality – a radical academic theory, which holds that all forms of  social oppression are inexorably linked.This radical concept has led to  the linking of disparate left-wing causes, no matter how tenuous their  connections. Some intersectional feminist activists, for example, insist that  feminists must oppose drone strikes (and by extension, Hillary Clinton), because  they negatively impact women in the developing world. Even more absurdly, Jill  Stein – the Green Party candidate for US president – has come out in favor of  the bigoted Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, partly on  the grounds that support for Israel furthers the interests of the  military-industrial complex, and by extension the fossil fuel  industry.Those activists who do not sufficiently embrace the new  intersectional orthodoxy, meanwhile, have been targeted by protests: The 2016  Gay Pride Parade in Toronto, for example, was broken up by Black Lives Matter  for including a police float, and for not sufficiently prioritizing the concerns  of black trans women. Similarly, a gay rights event in Chicago was broken up by  activists, who insisted on the exclusion of an Israeli organization, which they  claimed was coopting the gay rights agenda and “pinkwashing” Israeli crimes  against Palestinians.Intersectionality seems to be driving hard-left  activists toward a “No True Scotsman” worldview: Increasingly, they insist on a  package of unrelated left-wing causes that must be embraced by anyone claiming  the label of progressive – including the demonization of Israel as a racist,  apartheid state.Perhaps more worryingly, intersectionality tends toward  the conclusion that the existing social, political and economic system is flawed  in so many profound ways that any attempt at remaking it through democratic  means is unacceptable.Activists have become increasingly obsessed with  “Shut it Down” protest tactics, and a proud politics of “disrespectability,”  that prioritizes resistance to a “corrupt,” “rigged” socioeconomic system over  respectful discourse and political compromise.This helps to explain the  sympathetic attitude of Black Lives Matter activists toward groups such as  Hamas, which embrace terrorism as a mode of resistance against  Israel.Indeed, Black Lives Matter activists have visited Gaza to express  solidarity with Palestinians oppressed by so-called racist Israeli self-defense  measures. While Black Lives Matter claims to disavow violence in securing its  political objectives, many of its most prominent members are far more eager to  criticize the “Israeli genocide of Palestinians” than to criticize Hamas for  using rockets to target Israeli civilians. Black Lives Matter and other  hard-left groups have been notably silent about other oppressed ethnic groups  such as Tibetans, Chechens and Kurds. The only alleged “oppressors” they single  out for condemnation are the Jews. This double standard raises legitimate  questions about their real motivations.
Moreover, the conflation of  police actions in American cities with Israeli military actions in Gaza raises a  disturbing question: If the so-called oppression of Palestinians in Gaza and the  oppression of people of color in the United States are two sides of the same  coin – as the SJP implied in its tweet – are the violent resistance tactics  employed by Hamas, and perversely supported by many on the hard Left, an  appropriate model to emulate in the United States? One hopes that the answer is  no, and that the intersectionalist radicals will make that clear to their  followers.

<title>Why anti-BDS legislation is important... but ultimately limited</title>
<date>16/11/2016</date>
<content>
Only a week ago, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed a law that prevents his  state from contracting with entities that boycott Israel and other US allies.  Pennsylvania is the 16th state to pass such a law in the past year and a half.  Having reviewed these various efforts for the Jewish People Policy Institute’s  (JPPI) 2016 Annual Assessment of the Jewish People, important lessons can be  learned going forward. While these legislative initiatives are important and  positive, they are ultimately limited. To be most effective going forward, the  pro-Israel community will need to package them as part of a larger coherent  strategy.While many Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) supports no  doubt believe that boycotting Israel due to specific policies it enacts  regarding the Palestinians is indeed the goal, it is by now well known that for  the movement’s leadership and hard-core activists this is just another in a  series of tactics aimed at wearing away Israel’s legitimacy as a Jewish and  democratic state.




But something has changed. Over the past couple of  years, after (mostly successfully) blocking dozens of attempts to introduce BDS  initiatives on university campuses, in academic organizations, corporate  boardrooms and church halls, the American pro-Israel community decided to take  more proactive measures that are in line with the American people’s overwhelming  support of Israel.And it is doing this in the form of anti-BDS  legislation in states across the country.There are currently 12 states  that passed some sort of legislation specifically against boycotting Israel.  Some of these laws call on states to divest public pension funds from companies  that boycott Israel, while some prevent the state from contracting with such  companies. Some do both while others are only declaratory in nature.Four  more states, including California and Pennsylvania, passed general legislation  prohibiting the boycott of all US allies and trading partners, although it is  clear that defending Israel lies at the heart of these. The majority of these  laws passed in a bipartisan manner and with overwhelming support. More states  are expected to join in the coming year.Many see this as an important  bulwark against the onslaught against Israel and its economy. Certainly if one  reads Israeli and American-Jewish newspapers, as well as pro-BDS websites, it  seems as if the whole world has turned against Israel.But a hard look at  the actual successes of the BDS movement turns up very little. Despite the  propaganda, we can say with confidence that from an economic, cultural, academic  and especially a diplomatic perspective the BDS movement is largely failing;  Israel’s position in the world, in many ways, has never been  better.However, it’s important to point out that the threat of BDS was  never economic, cultural or even diplomatic in the narrow sense. Every time a  boycott resolution is raised, a speaker silenced, an artist harassed so they  avoid Israel, etc., it is accompanied by a campaign of half-truths,  exaggerations, facts out of context and flat-out lies. These are meant to  rewrite the narrative and convert hearts and minds in order to vilify and  demonize Israel and its very existence; any specific successes along the way are  a bonus.The danger is that over time, and aided by the prevalence of  social media, Israel’s image and thus perceptions of its legitimacy will erode  to the point where it actually turns into a pariah. After all, much of what  drives social movements, even those based on exaggeration and fiction, is  momentum, peer pressure and mob mentality.And so, anti-BDS legislative  initiatives are important because they make an important statement. They show  that the vast majority of Americans stand ever stronger by Israel. This is  important in offering public support for companies and institutions targeted by  BDS bullying and harassment smear campaigns.On another level, they keep  anti-Israel activists busy.Having to constantly be on the defensive put  Israel supporters in a disadvantageous position, having to explain why Israel is  not committing genocide or apartheid or ethnic cleansing, or any one of a number  of gross and false accusations. Thus, these laws put the BDS crowd on the  defensive, having to justify its ludicrous attacks and exposing the hypocritical  and shaky foundations of its efforts.On a higher level, the legislation  helps clear the “wheat from the chaff” among those who limit business or divest  for purely financial reasons. The case of British global security giant G4S  illustrates this best. After a long and aggressive harassment campaign, the  company said it was looking to divest from Israel, which BDS claimed as one of  its victories. To avoid losing Illinois state contracts, G4S had to prove that  its decision was financial and not ideological and therefore discriminatory. G4S  eventually announced that it will “maintain a significant presence in Israel for  decades to come, and continue to be a key contributor to the security of  Israel.”The early wave of proactive successes should not, however,  distract from the larger issue. The struggle to defend Israel is a complex and  ideological one.Bullying companies to divest from Israel is but a tactic  within a larger effort. These legislative initiatives may help win this  individual battle but as we have seen, the “anti-Israel campaign of hate” known  as BDS will regroup and look for new ways to attack.Israel and its  supporters must take advantage of these victories, and the buffer they provide,  to take further proactive moves and keep BDS on the run. Just as the anti-Israel  movement uses BDS initiatives as tactics to delegitimize Israel, so must the  pro-Israel camp use these legislations as a move within a larger and  comprehensive strategy – one that seeks to reclaim and reframe a positive  narrative about Israel’s legitimacy.

<title>Why college students who fight for social justice should support Israel</title>
<date>19/1/2016</date>
<content>
Jewish college students growing up in the American Reform  movement bring the movement’s passion for social justice with them to campus;  for many it defines their Judaism. On campus, they naturally come into the  company of other social activists, some of whom despise the very existence of  the Jewish State of Israel.It is difficult for these Jewish students to  differentiate between social activists who support a Jewish state but are  troubled by the “occupation,” or don’t like its current leaders, from those who  want Israel to entirely disappear, partially because the more clever among the  latter, mortal enemies of the Jewish state soft-pedal their agenda, claiming to  object only to settlements.




It is cool to be anti-Israel on campus,  especially when Israel is portrayed as an occupying, human-rights-abusing,  racist, apartheid state that colonized a territory and ethnically cleansed its  indigenous inhabitants. The problem is compounded by the fact that the  anti-Israel far Left is disproportionately represented among college professors,  who naturally command the respect of their students.To combat these peer  and mentor sources of anti-Israel propaganda, a strategy must be created that  creates space and time for these kids to hear all the arguments, and to  understand how their passion for social activism can be channeled in a positive  pro-Israel way.So the first thing that pro-Israel organizations need to  do is to help make apparent the difference between those who have reasonable  gripes about particular aspects of Israel but want to support it, and those who  are determined to destroy it.For Reform kids this should, one hopes,  begin in their synagogues, when they are still in middle and high school. A  healthy respect for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state must be a  foundational principle. If all they hear growing up is criticism of Israel, and  their only trip to Israel is with an organization that highlights the negatives  of Israel while whitewashing the misogyny, homophobia and intolerance of  Palestinian society, then it is up to rabbis, parents and donors of the Reform  movement to demand a change.Social Justice promotes a society based on  justice, where there is equal access to the judiciary and rule of law. It is a  movement where women, minorities and those of differing sexual orientation are  tolerated and do not fear. That is the very definition of Israel. The human  rights groups and progressive news sources the kids read trumpet Israel’s  supposed faults, and ignore those of its enemies.My colleague Bret  Stephens of The Wall Street Journal inspired me to ask our kids who are  concerned about social justice in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the  Muslim world the following questions: Are you in favor of women’s rights? Are  you in favor of freedom of the press? Are you in favor of religious tolerance?  Are you in favor of gay rights? Are you in favor of freedom of speech? Are you  in favor of democracy? Then you should be a supporter of Israel.As  Ambassador Dennis Ross wrote, “For now and the foreseeable future, [Israel] will  remain the only country in the Middle East governed by the rule of law,  separation of powers, an independent judiciary, regularly scheduled elections  where the losers accept the outcome, freedom of speech and assembly, a vibrant  and open media, respect for women’s rights and for gay rights, artistic freedom,  active civil society groups-and an innovative, dynamic economy.”How do  we get that message to our kids in college, and how can we convince liberal  Jewish movements that it is important to emphasize Israel’s accomplishments  while defending Israel’s right to exist despite its warts? A positive message  for Israel will only go so far. Mainstream Jewish organizations, including the  Reform movement, need to take the gloves off and go on the offensive, applying  the same standards for the Palestinians as for Israel. So much is made of harsh  interrogations of would-be bus-bombers in Israel, but the progressive voices on  campus never mention the much more egregious PA and Hamas torture of  Palestinians, the honor killings of women, or the utter humiliation of  homosexuals.These should be progressive causes of social justice,  instead of excusing Israel’s neighbors.Dr. Ammar Dwaik, director-general  of the Independent Commission for Human Rights, a Palestinian group, revealed  that his group received 782 complaints regarding torture – 168 in the West Bank  and 614 in the Gaza Strip.According to Arab-Israeli journalist Khaled  Abu Toameh, “The two Palestinian governments.... are both major violators of  human rights. The PA has used international funds to build prisons and detention  centers in the West Bank where torture has become the norm.”Amnesty  International’s 2015 Annual Report on the Palestinian Authority reported:  Security authorities in both the West Bank and Gaza arbitrarily arrested and  detained their critics and supporters of rival political  organizations.Torturing Political Prisoners: “Detainees were tortured  and otherwise ill-treated with impunity” No Fair Trials: “Authorities in the  West Bank held detainees for indefinite periods without charge or  trial.”Suppressing Free Speech: “Authorities restricted freedoms of  expression, association and assembly in the West Bank and Gaza.... Security  officials also harassed and sought to intimidate journalists and social media  activists.”Violence Against Women: “Women and girls continued to face  discrimination in both law and practice, and remained inadequately protected  against gender-based violence committed by male relatives, ostensibly for  reasons of family ‘honor.’ At least 11 women and girls were murdered by male  relatives in so-called ‘honor killings’ during the year.”A 2013 Pew  report on Palestinian views on women found 87 percent of Palestinians think  women must obey their husbands.Is this anything a modern Reform Jewish  college student can support? We must help our kids to understand the hypocrisy  of supporting and defending cultures that do not share our values of individual  rights, women’s rights, rule of law and a genuine judiciary in the name of  cultural relativism. We must make our young adults understand that the weaker  party is not always the victim or in the right. We must make them understand  that Israel tries to live up to a standard that conforms with their social  justice values as much as any people in history has, but that it is incredibly  hard when the vast majority of your neighbors want to annihilate you, preach  hatred to their children and shoot missiles from schoolyards.Israel,  like any other complex real-world democracy, has real social justice  issues.But overall Israel needs to be seen by these young people as the  miracle it is, something to be proud of, an experiment in developing a  democratic, pluralistic, liberal, free nation in a Middle Eastern desert where  nothing like that has ever taken root before.Now it is up to pro-Israel  college organizations, liberal Jewish movements, and mainstream Jewish groups,  to come together and express a positive social justice message that supports the  Jewish state.

<title>Will free speech on Israel survive progressive censorship?</title>
<date>30/3/2016</date>
<content>
I remember, from my younger days, the controversies over the proposed Nazi march  in Skokie Illinois in 1978. Skokie was a Jewish suburb of Chicago, with a high  concentration of survivors of the Shoah. The Nazi march was specifically chosen  to take place in this Jewish suburb, to outrage, intimidate, and gain notoriety  for their odious genocidal agenda.Unlike post-World War II Europe that  chose to deal with Nazism by outlawing it and imposing criminal penalties for  using or promoting Nazi agendas or symbols, the United States chose to remain  true to one of the core principles of its founders, allowing free speech with  few exceptions, such as yelling “fire” in a theater.




Jewish liberals and  activists from the ACLU defended the Nazis’ right to march and display the  swastika as a form of free speech. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that any ban  was unconstitutional.How times have changed.Today the ACLU and  progressive farleft activists, many of them Jewish, fail to object to the  assault on pro-Israel free speech on American college campuses and in the public  arena, no doubt because the calls for denial of free speech come from their own  ranks.Pro-Israel speakers are now routinely shouted down, forced off the  stage of public discourse by Palestinian and “social justice” activists. Just  ask ambassador Michael Oren, or Palestinian human rights advocate Bassem Eid,  whose crime was talking about co-existing with Israelis. At Brandeis University,  Brandeis president Frederick Lawrence withdrew Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s invitation to  speak there, because she speaks out against Islamic female genital mutilation  and other human rights violations in the Islamic world.These  “open-minded” progressives claim friends of Israel shouldn’t be allowed to  speak, because of Israel’s supposed war crimes against Palestinians, Western  colonialism, apartheid, human rights abuses, genocide of the Palestinian people,  ethnic cleansing of the indigenous inhabitants, use of disproportionate force,  targeting of Palestinian children, etc. Then boycotting, demonizing and  sanctioning Israel is then only a natural next step.They further claim  that shouting down pro-Israel speakers is their form of free speech. George  Orwell must be turning over in his grave.As Ruth Wisse writes in The  Wall Street Journal, “Campus anti-Israel coalitions exploit freedom of speech  and assembly to assail the only Middle Eastern country that guarantees those  freedoms.”Within the Progressive far Left, there is a singular lack of  respect and toleration for differing opinions, not only on the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A recent Progressive recommendation is to use RICO  law enforcement statutes designed for the Mafia and drug cartels to suppress the  free speech of those who challenge some of the claims of climate change  advocates. In the eyes of Progressives, climate change deniers are now  equivalent to Pablo Escobar and the Corleone family. The idea that it is a  legitimate Progressive tactic to intimidate opposing voices by using the RICO  statutes should be frightening to everyone across the political  spectrum.Not to be outdone, on the populist Right is the dangerous  rhetoric of Donald Trump, who also exhibits an utter disdain for differing  viewpoints, viciously attacking individuals who disagree with his agenda in a  manner more akin to Peron or Chavez than any previous American aspiring to be  president.As for the intimidation and suppression of free speech by  anti-boycott activists, Richard Cravats in The American Thinker offers: “The  disturbing campaign to suppress speech... is a troubling and recurrent pattern  of behavior by ‘progressive’ leftists and ‘social justice’ advocates from  Muslim-led pro-Palestinian groups... [it] promote[s] a relentless campaign  against Israel in the form of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS)...  university officials and student groups who now try to suppress all thought of  which they disapprove have sacrificed one of the core values for which the  university exists... the truth.”So what to do? On the Right, many  American conservatives have already publicly challenged and repudiated Trump’s  scapegoating and bullying tactics. An open letter by 120 members of the  Republican foreign policy establishment denounced Trump’s inflammatory foreign  policy rhetoric.But for supporters of Israel and those who want to fight  against the anti-Semitic, anti-free speech BDS movement, the problem lies almost  exclusively with the progressive far Left.A recent encouraging sign was  the superb work of Professor Tammi Rossman- Benjamin, who led a coalition of  groups that included MEPIN that persuaded the California Board of Regents to  acknowledge that some forms of anti-Zionism are truly  anti-Semitic.Although not quite an acceptance of the US State Department  definition of anti-Semitism, the Californian Board of Regents decision is no  half-loaf victory, especially when you realize that California academia is  overwhelmingly biased against Israel, and more times than not encourages BDS in  the classrooms.So how do you stop the anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist  protesters from denying a pro-Israel activist the right to speak, uninterrupted,  in a public or private space? Can you create a strategy to preemptively stop  disrupting protesters from denying a pro-Israel advocates their right to free  speech? On the college campus it needs to begin with the administration, alumni  and financial supporters of universities.Pro-Israel funders and alumni  need to make it crystal clear to the administration of our universities that  continued financial support is contingent on protecting free speech, especially  of pro-Israel supporters, the ones overwhelmingly under attack.According  to Gerald Steinberg of NGO Monitor, “A major law firm that gave student groups  at the Harvard Law School a million-dollar donation changed course after  learning that some of the money went to promote campaigns that single out  Israel.”Liberal and conservative intellectuals and thinkers need to come  together to publicly disavow suppression of free speech. Even in our  hyperpolarized political world, there are many good people across the spectrum  that would support letters and advertisements to protect and promote free speech  for all, repudiating the shouting down of pro-Israel speakers as a legitimate  tactic of free speech.The effort can begin in a bipartisan fashion in  Congress, between respectful academics, or be initiated by mainstream pro-Israel  organizations like AJC or ADL.Calling all Americans: protect our free  speech.

Inching toward an apartheid state
The Israeli regime, which showed tolerance, conditional on good behavior, toward the Palestinian public in Israel and its leaders, is beginning to move in the direction of dark regimes. The apartheid regime of South Africa is an example of the kind of regime to which Israel may deteriorate.

The assault on the political activity of Palestinians in Israel over the past few days is unprecedented, even compared to the assailment on the Al-Arad movement in the 1960s. Most of the Palestinian public in Israel and all of its prominent leaders express a position in favor of acknowledgment of the State of Israel; but, at the same time, oppose the discriminatory regime that the Jews have established over the last 50 years.

The Israeli regime has firmly established its position as one that first and foremost serves the Jews in Israel and the Diaspora; and in order to do so, it is willing to take harsh measures against the Palestinian public in Israel. Land expropriation, citizenship laws, immigration laws, orientation of capital, and the development and division of the geographic space are all basic components of the structure of the Jewish-Israel regime. All these means constitute tools to strengthen the Jewish majority and exclude the Palestinian minority. In many cases, they even serve as tools to harm the minority.

The extension of the right to political participation to the Palestinian minority that remained in Israel after the deportation of the remainder of the Palestinians was a step that expressed two intentions toward the minority with the aim of serving the majority. The intention was, on the one hand, to include the minority in response to demands from the international community and also reflected the position of some of the founding fathers of the state who saw Israel as a Western and democratic state. But, on the other hand, it also served to include the Palestinians in the political process as a means of control aimed at creating a division between them and the other Palestinians and creating a false hope with regard to their integration into the society emerging in Israel.

The disqualification of Ahmed Tibi's candidacy by the Central Elections Committee and the expected hearing on the petition submitted by the attorney general to disqualify the Balad list come on top of steps, apparently coordinated, that have been taken - or will be taken in the near future - against other factions among the Palestinian public in Israel. Among these steps, one can cite the closure of the Islamic Movement's newspaper, attempts to undermine some of the leaders of the Islamic Movement and, in particular, the desire to deal a mortal blow to the emerging new movement of election boycotters and seekers of institutional alternatives outside of the Jewish-Israeli power base.

These attempts, which have intensified in recent weeks, are proof of the negative shift in the foundations of the Jewish-Israeli regime toward becoming a regime that acts against some of its citizens, especially in view of the fact that in the last decade nothing significant has changed in the views and positions of the various political factions among the Palestinians in Israel.

The Israeli regime, which showed tolerance, conditional on good behavior, toward the Palestinian public in Israel and its leaders, is beginning to move in the direction of dark regimes. The apartheid regime of South Africa, until the revolution of the end of the previous century, is an example of the kind of regime to which Israel will deteriorate if it continues to adopt an extreme right-wing line against its Palestinian citizens, even if whoever leads the way, or justifies it, is a representative of the law, such as the attorney general or even the High Court of Justice.

The challenge currently facing Jews and Palestinians who wish to live together is how to deter the attempts of the nationalist Israeli right to make all our lives insufferable, and how to offer an alternative that will ensure the inclusion of Palestinian civilians - and not their exclusion. This must be done both out of a commitment to true equality based on personal and collective equality for all parts of Israeli society, including the Palestinians, and also out of a commitment to regime change and the inception of a democratic regime based on a a fair and open outlook to all citizens - and not one that systematically assails its Palestinian citizens.

This is our challenge for the future, and certainly the challenge facing the Supreme Court in the coming days.

U.S. says wants 'broad participation' in Knesset elections
Boucher says administration will follow closely High Court appeal against Tibi, Bishara, Balad disqualifications.
By Haaretz Staff	and Reuters	| Jan. 1, 2003 | 12:00 AM

The United States said late Thursday it wanted to see broad participation in this month's elections, implicitly criticizing the preliminary disqualification by the Central Elections Committee of Israeli Arab MKs Ahmed Tibi and Azmi Bishara and Bishara's Balad party.

"We're of course interested in broad participation in the political process in Israel, as we are elsewhere," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told a daily briefing.

"I'm not commenting on the particular individuals or the parties or the political aspects of this. I'm commenting on the question of the broadest possible participation in the political process," he added.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear next Tuesday the disqualified Arab candidates' appeal of the election committee's decision to bar them from running in the Knesset. It will also hear an appeal against the committee's decision to allow far-right Herut candidate Baruch Marzel to run.

Eleven judges will hear the appeal of Bishara and Balad, whom the CEC disqualified early Wednesday, and MK Ahmed Tibi, who was disqualified Monday. The court will have no more than two days to deliberate as it must come to a conclusion by January 9.

If Balad and Bishara are not reinstated, Balad is likely to call on Israeli Arabs to boycott the elections.

"Azmi and Balad are one and the same," said Jamal Zahalka, No. 2 on the Balad list. "Our approach is that even if only Bishara's disqualification is upheld, the entire Balad list won't compete in the elections."

Balad plans to conduct a protest gathering at the weekend in Nazareth, and demonstrations are expected Wednesday in Tel Aviv and Taibeh, where Tibi lives, to protest his disqualification.

"This is a totally political decision," said Zahalka. "The Israeli right is continuing to try to create political apartheid for Arabs in Israel."

Boucher said the United States was following closely the case of the Israeli Arab politicians. "We'll... see what happens as it proceeds to review by the courts," he added.

CEC mulls employing external council for High Court hearings
11 judges to decide whether to uphold Central Elections Committee decision to disqualify Bishara, Balad and allow to Marzel to run.
By Haaretz Staff	| Jan. 1, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The presidium of the Central Elections Committee met Wednesday to debate a proposal to retain the services of an outside attorney to represent it at next week's High Court hearing of appeals against the decision to disqualify MK Ahmed Tibi and to allow the candidacy of Herut number two Baruch Marzel.

Likud Knesset member Michael Eitan and Yehuda Avidan of Shas claimed at the meeting that, since the attorney general's representative on the CEC, attorney Talia Sasson, had expressed a different opinion to that of the committee itself, the CEC must be represented by an external attorney. They claimed that this is to counter any possible accusations of improper decision-making, such as unprofessional behavior and being unprepared for the hearings.

The chairman of the CEC, Justice Mishael Cheshin, did not state his view on the issue, but told the presidium that he would accept its decision. The Labor Party has petitioned the High Court over the decision to allow Marzel to compete. In their petition, which has been signed by 17 members of the CEC, the plaintiffs claim that the decision is unreasonable and fundamentally flawed, both legally and in terms of the facts.

They claim that the committee ignored the evidence presented, the relevant legal instructions and legal precedents, as well as the opinion of Cheshin himself. Labor sources added that the decision to allow Marzel to run endangers the foundations of the rule of law, by severely damaging the principle that Israel is a democratic country. They added that the ruling allows Marzel and his associates to abuse the democratic process to enter the Knesset and to spread racist and extremist views therein. According to Labor, Marzel is a Trojan horse for the banned Kach movement he once headed.

Katsav: Banning candidates no cause for crisis in Arab sector President Moshe Katsav said Wednesday that in his opinion the CEC decision to disqualify Arab candidates did not justify a break of trust between Arabs and Jews in Israel.

"The Central Elections Committee decision does not decrease the representation of Israeli Arabs in the Knesset, only the Arab voters, with their vote alone, determine the number of Arab representatives in the next Knesset," Katsav said.

Katsav also said that final decision to disqualify Knesset candidate lists will be made by the Supreme Court and not by the (CEC), which disqualified MK Azmi Biashara, his Balad party and MK Ahmed Tibi from running in the Knesset elections.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear next Tuesday the disqualified Arab candidates' appeal of the election committee's decisions to bar them from running in the Knesset. It will also hear an appeal against the committee's decision to allow far-right Herut candidate Baruch Marzel to run.

Balad plans to conduct a protest gathering at the end of the week in Nazareth, and demonstrations are expected Wednesday in Tel Aviv and Taibeh, where Tibi lives, to protest his disqualification.

"This is a totally political decision," said Zahalka. "The Israeli right is continuing to try to create political apartheid for Arabs in Israel."

Former foreign minister Shimon Peres (Labor) said Wednesday that disqualifying Tibi, Bishara and Balad is a mistake and will increase the division between Jews and Arabs.

The election committee's Wednesday decision overrode the opinion of committee chairman High Court Justice Mishael Cheshin, who said Bishara and Balad should be allowed to run, but was supported by Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein.

The decision, taken by a one-vote margin, followed controversial decisions earlier this week to disqualify the Knesset candidacy of Arab MK Ahmed Tibi and allow extreme rightist Baruch Marzel to run.

Labor Party Secretary Ophir Pines-Paz and senior Labor lawman MK Effi Oshaya said Wednesday they plan to appeal the committee's decision to allow Marzel to run. Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit refused their request to join the petition, Army Radio reported.

Cheshin was quoted as telling the committee that Bishara's past expressions of support of the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah in Lebanon had angered him, but that "Israel's democracy is strong and can tolerate irregular cases." He said there was insufficient evidence to disqualify Bishara or Balad.

In contrast, Rubinstein had charged that Bishara and Balad reject Israel's existence as the state of the Jewish people and support the armed struggle against Israel. By law, either of those charges is sufficient to disqualify either a party or an individual.

The decision to disqualify Tibi went against the opinions of both Cheshin and Rubinstein.

On Wednesday, Bishara tried to address all the points raised by Rubinstein, one by one.

"I believe that a people living under occupation has the right to fight against it, but I never called on the Palestinians to embark on an armed struggle against Israel. I never supported violent activity," he said.

Cheshin and several committee members tried to elicit a clear denunciation from Bishara of attacks on either civilians, soldiers or settlers, in Israel or in the territories. Bishara's response was: "Attacks on innocent civilians, wherever they are, are unacceptable to me."

Asked why he has never publicly denounced attacks on women and children, he responded that no law obliges him to do so, but on the personal level, he is appalled by the murder of children, or by incidents such as the lynching of two reservists in Ramallah at the start of the intifada.

Bishara attacked Rubinstein not only for requesting his disqualification, but also for supporting his request with material about Bishara collected by the Shin Bet security service. This material, he charged, contained "blatant lies" - such as that he had urged Balad supporters to throw stones at demonstrations or that he favors expelling all Jews who immigrated after 1948.

Where are we going?

Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, said in 1947 that in the Jewish state, "there must not be one law for the Jews and another for the Arabs." The decision to disqualify MK Azmi Bishara and his party, Balad, from running in the Knesset elections, taken by the political appointees in the Central Elections Committee against the views of its chair, Supreme Court Justice Mishael Cheshin, is exactly what Weizmann feared.

Former Supreme Court justice Yitzhak Zamir said the committee's behavior was "scandalous and shameful;" while Cheshin likened the committee to a circus and a kindergarten. How then can its decision annul the promise in Israel's Declaration of Independence that the state "will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race or sex?"

MK Bishara called much of the Shin Bet security service inspired "evidence" against him - that he denied the existence of Israel as a Jewish state and that he supported an armed struggle against the state - "blatant lies." He said as an Israeli citizen who supported the national struggle of the Palestinian people, he was not part of the Israeli consensus; but now they also wanted to deny his right to be part of the controversy.

Defending Bishara's rightto run for the Knesset must be seen by all Israelis who cherish democracy - be they Zionist or post-Zionist, secular or religious, left or right - as a dividing line between democracy and equal rights, on the one side, and legalized discrimination and apartheid, on the other.

Now, the Supreme Court must make a fateful decision that will resolve in which direction Israeli society is moving.

Argentine immigrants recruited to `stop Arab takeover' in Katzir
By Mazal Mualem	| Jan. 5, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Five new-immigrant families from Argentina arrived at the Harish community in Wadi Ara last week, joining the six immigrant families who arrived at the beginning of last month as part of the Katzir-Harish local council's effort "to stop the creeping Arab settlement" there.

Thirty more Argentinian families, who were persuaded to come to Israel specifically for this purpose, are to arrive in Harish in the next few weeks.

Katzir-Harish council head Dubi Sanderov said that since the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Arab organizations, including the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, have been acting to settle Arabs in Katzir and Harish for "political and provocative reasons" and "it is possible that Arab elements outside Israel are encouraging it."

"We have no problem with individual Arabs interested in living here, but we feel there is an organized takeover bid, and we have no intention of giving in to it. We're acting to bring new immigrants here, because this is one way of preserving the Jewish character of these communities," Sanderov said.

The Katzir and Harish communities were established at the beginning of the 1980s as part of then housing minister Ariel Sharon's "seven star" plan to beef up Jewish settlement in the north. Despite Sharon's vision of settling 30,000 Jews in the two communities, their population currently totals only 3,500, 40 percent of whom are new immigrants, and 150 Arabs (70 of whom are members of the Karaja clan who were moved there from Ramle).

But the council's attractive offers and relatively low housing costs failed to attract established residents, especially since the intifada began. In addition, dozens of families have abandoned the communities following the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada and put their homes up for rent at especially low prices - $200 to $250 for a four-room apartment. Now, in anticipation of the war in Iraq, many are keeping their homes empty so they can flee to them in emergency, assuming the area is protected since it lies in the heart of Arab territory.

In this situation, new immigrants have become much in demand. When it appeared that many Argentinian Jews are in severe financial straits due to the economic crisis there, the council sent Pichi Dubiner, who arrived 20 years ago from Argentina, on a recruiting mission. Dubiner went to Argentina and managed to persuade 40 families, most of them young couples with one to three children, to immigrate to Katzir and Harish.

"I explained to them that the whole state of Israel is under the same security threat, and that they would be coming to a rural community with a high quality of life," he said.

Harish prepared a warm, cordial welcome for the new immigrants, giving each family a furnished apartment and an adoptive family.

Shawki Khatib, head of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee called Sanderov's claims of an attempted Arab takeover of Katzir and Harish "paranoia."

Committee spokesman Abed Anabtawi labeled Sanderov's claims "unfounded nonsense. We are indeed acting to enable every Arab to live wherever he wants to, as part of his legitimate rights as a citizen, otherwise this would be an apartheid state." He denied there was any organized bid to settle Arabs in a specific place.

In March 2000 the High Court of Justice forbade the State of Israel to discriminate between Arabs and Jews in land allocation. The precedent-setting ruling came in response to the petition of the couple Adal and Iman Qadan, whose attempt to buy a home in Katzir, a community established by the Jewish Agency, was rejected. The High Court ruled in their favor.

But despite the ruling, Arabs who wish to build a home in Katzir are rejected by the community's acceptance committee, which must approve anyone wishing to buy land. However, renting or buying a Housing Ministry-built apartment does not require the committee's approval and there are 35 such apartments available in Katzir and 140 in Harish.

The council is making no secret of trying to prevent Arabs from inhabiting these apartments. One way of doing so is through the municipal debt collection department, which reports every case in which Arabs try to find out whether the previous tenants of a particular apartment have debts. This usually indicates an interest in buying or renting an apartment, and the council then tries to take over the property and place new immigrants in it.

Fears of disloyalty

Those Jews among us who grew up in the Diaspora are well acquainted with the common accusation: you Jews have dual loyalties and cannot be trusted to be loyal to the state. We did our best to prove that we really were loyal and did not put "international Jewish concerns" and Israel before our responsibilities as citizens. But our concern for the well-being of our fellow Jews never left our minds, and we continued our Zionist activities.

Since 1948 and the establishment of Israel, the Palestinian Israelis have been suspected of being a fifth column. However, until the second intifada, more Jews than Muslims or Christians were arrested and convicted of spying against the state. Yet, our Jewish citizenry is still so insecure as to accuse every Palestinian Israeli politician of disloyalty. Yes, they are concerned about their fellow Palestinians who are being starved and oppressed by Israel. Yes, they try to help them. Yes, they are looking for a peaceful solution to the problem.

While the Jewish idea of a suitable solution might not be identical with that of the Palestinian Israelis, this does not make them traitors. There can never be a solution that is not acceptable to the Palestinians themselves, whether Israeli or otherwise. Peace is achieved through mutual efforts, a fact that seems to escape the consciousness of many Israelis. Punishing Palestinian Israeli politicians because of our fears of their disloyalty is counter-productive. What would have happened if the United States had treated American Jews the way we are treating non-Jews here? What would we have said and thought?

The time has come to stop justifying our biased treatment of the stranger in our midst on the basis of our fears. We are just forcing them to be disloyal in order to protect themselves and their brothers over the border.

A higher good

I am writing in support of those members of the Israel Defense Forces who refuse to serve in the occupied territories. The recent Supreme Court decision rejecting their claim of "selective" conscientious objection is just plain wrong in its logic and reasoning. These individuals, while perhaps not heroes to the majority of Israelis, are upholding the value of moral conscience. Their refusal to honor a military directive on grounds of adhering to a higher moral good is a hallowed strategy in all civil liberties struggles.

The best analogy to recent American history I can think of is the civil rights movement. Martin Luther King held that laws which denied basic rights to blacks could and should be violated because the "law breaking"

protesters were following a "higher law." His white opponents, like Israel's Supreme Court in its ruling, said that King's views would lead to social chaos because every citizen would pick and choose which laws they wished to obey and which they chose to disobey. But King's position has withstood the test of time. American society did not collapse in a sea of lawlessness. Rather, the majority of Americans eventually came to see King's struggle as a righteous one; and they rejected the Southern white conservatives who warned of social chaos.

Voice of the Other

Regarding "Five rules set by the Kingdom of the Settlements" by Amira Hass and "Inching toward an apartheid state" by Assad Ganem, January 1:

In their articles both Dr. Assad Ganem and Amira Hass provided an accurate analysis of Israeli society. Unfortunately, the situation that they have described is a chilling one of ethnocratic rule on the part of Jewish Israelis who find "uppity" Arab MKs, who've accurately described both the discrimination faced by their constituents and the repression of the occupation, guilty of the crime of political expression that somehow contradicts the normative (ultra) Zionist paradigm. Their sentence, of course, is to be silenced. Yet, the silence imposed upon them is deafening. It screams out that we are unwilling to allow the voice of the Other to be heard. This is most frightening and disturbing.

British minister calls for Zimbabwe boycott
By Reuters	| Jan. 6, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
LONDON - British government minister Peter Hain has called for the England cricket team to boycott their World Cup match in Zimbabwe, saying to play there would be a "propaganda victory" for the country's president Robert Mugabe.

"I don't think England cricketers should go - and if they did and if the World Cup goes ahead in Harare and Bulawayo, it will be exploited and milked mercilessly by Robert Mugabe and his odious regime whilst people starve outside," Welsh Secretary Hain said on BBC television yesterday.

Zimbabwe is scheduled to host six of the 54 matches in the World Cup tournament, which is being staged mainly in South Africa from February 9 to March 23. England is due to play Zimbabwe in Harare on February 13.

Mugabe has received widespread criticism for his controversial land reform program, a policy opponents blame for the country's deepening economic crisis and food shortages.

The British government has said it cannot order the England team not to play in Zimbabwe, while the England and Wales Cricket Board has said it wants a decision from the government. The two sides are set to meet later this week.

Hain, who as a young man campaigned against the apartheid regime in South Africa, said: "We're not telling the cricket authorities to do anything. We are saying it's morally wrong to play and give Mugabe and his tyranny a propaganda victory, which is what will happen.

"The idea that cricketers or cricket officials are absolved from moral decisions seems to me to be wrong. We all have to take moral decisions in the jobs that we do."

He added: "We don't think we should be handing Mugabe a propaganda victory anymore than we should have handed Hitler in 1936 a propaganda victory that he got by staging the Berlin Olympics as he did then."

Israel preventing PA parliament speaker from attending session
By The Associated Press	| Jan. 13, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) said Monday that Israel had prevented him from traveling to Ramallah to open a session of the legislature. The army, which oversees travel through military checkpoints in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said it was checking the report.

The Cabinet decided last week to limit travel by Palestinian officials as part of its response to suicide bombings in Tel Aviv that killed 23 people.

Qureia said he requested authorization from Israeli officials to cross through two military checkpoints between his hometown of Abu Dis on the outskirts of Jerusalem and Ramallah so that he could attend a session of the Palestinian Legislative Council. He said he was not given permission to make the trip.

"This is a continuation of the Israeli policy to implement the apartheid system and isolate the Palestinian people from each other," Qureia said in a telephone interview. "This is also an indicator of the Israeli intention to paralyze the Palestinian Authority and destroy it completely."

Last week, the Israeli Cabinet also decided to bar several senior Palestinian officials from attending an international conference in London. They were to discuss reforming the Palestinian Authority, one of several steps demanded by the U.S. administration and other governments as a precursor to the formation of a Palestinian state.

The infants tell the real story
Those looking at the Middle East from afar can see the gaps between the Jews in their country and the Muslims in their countries growing, and continuing to grow, while the gaps inside the besieged island shrink and continue to shrink, despite lengthy conflict and hostility.
By Amnon Rubinstein	Jan. 15, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The infant mortality rate in British Mandate Palestine in 1943-44, the last year for which such data are available, was almost 10 percent for Muslims, 3.5 percent for Jews, and 7 percent for Christians. There were three times as many infant deaths among Muslims, and twice as many among Christians, as there were among Jews.

Mortality rates for children up to the age of 5 were even more disgraceful - 21 percent among Muslims, 4.5 percent among Jews, and 10 percent among Christians. Muslims suffered a rate five times more, and Christians twice as much, as Jews. (The data are from the British Mandate Authority's annual statistical yearbook in the National Archives).

In Israel 2001 all the mortality rates were dramatically lower of course, but no less important, gaps between Jews and Arabs have also shrunk. The infant mortality rate among Jews was 0.14 percent, among Muslims 0.82 percent, and among Christians 0.2 percent. The gap between Jews and Muslims had dropped by a third and the gap between Jews and Christians was reversed.

Even more dramatic was the narrowing of the gap in child mortality rates among children up to the age of 5. The Muslim rate sank from the 21 percent to 0.5 percent and the gap between Muslims to Jews had shrunk from five times more to double.

This is dramatic, unprecedented progress unknown to the public, and is in contrast with Arab states where infant mortality is much higher than in Israel among all population groups. Infant mortality in wealthy Kuwait, for example, is 1.2 percent - twice that of Muslims in Israel.

Infant and child mortality rates are one of the unequivocal measures of success in a welfare state. Infant mortality is an indicator of the situation in the Middle East. Israel is a besieged island in an Arab and Muslim region, but the siege has only increased the enormous gaps between the Jewish state and the world around it.

Inside the besieged island live a minority that in culture, religion and nationality belong to those besieging the island, and it also suffers from a sense of discrimination and real discrimination.

But those looking at the Middle East from afar can see the gaps between the Jews in their country and the Muslims in their countries growing, and continuing to grow, while the gaps inside the besieged island shrink and continue to shrink, despite lengthy conflict and hostility.

This has enormous long-term importance, even while a gaping chasm between Jews and Arabs in Israel persists. We must not rest until all the gaps between all parts of Israeli society have been eliminated in general, and between Jews and Arabs in particular.

But at a time when Israel is criticized at home and abroad as an apartheid state, it is worth noting the infant mortality rates and the shrinking gaps in education and health from the past to the present, as an indication of reality.

It is a complex reality and very different from the mendacious, fashionable statements made about Israel. A paradox has been created in this reality. In the years that the political polarization between Jews and Arabs in Israel, especially of course, because of the war with the Palestinians, the social polarization has narrowed, at least as far as it is measured in health and education data. Even the most vehement critic of Israel cannot allow himself to ignore this data.

Sharon is a life- long intimidator

Regarding "Humiliation undermines security," by Alouph Hareven, Ha'aretz January 12 Alouph Hareven rightly calls for training soldiers to treat average Palestinians with dignity, but he dances around the invisible elephant in the room. Such a change will never happen without the prime minister setting a tone of respect from the top. And the current prime minister will never do it.

Public statements and gestures offer tremendous potential. Based on good will, they can nudge the emotional climate in a better direction, something that is desperately needed. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's words and deeds, however, reveal him as a lifelong provoker and intimidator, not a trust-builder.

An Israeli prime minister today should be working tirelessly to identify, encourage and strengthen coexistence-minded Palestinian moderates and respond positively to their gestures. The old Sharon strategy of heavier retaliation can never secure the future, as Amram Mitzna points out.

Part of the formula for real peace is for the prime minister to affirm publicly, once and for all, basic respect for the human dignity that Palestinians share with all peoples as a birthright and to acknowledge their legitimate national narrative. Another part is to create many more opportunities for Jewish-Palestinian dialogue. The fact that most Israelis have never had a conversation with a Palestinian contributes greatly to the mutual demonization. Men like Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin were able to transcend the past. They had the courage to reach beyond it and express a vision of peace to their own people and even more significantly, to the other side. Amram Mitzna is clearly in that mold. Ariel Sharon never can be.

One man, one vote, one country

Regarding "Like sheep to a Palestinian state," by Nadav Shragai, Ha'aretz, January 13

Nadav Shragai says about a proposed Palestinian state that "all the signs indicate that the Palestinians' motivation to see us destroyed is not waning, rather the opposite."

But if this is true, it spells the death knell of the two-state solution. Let's get real. It is also perfectly understandable. Underlying Israel was as much ethnic-religious cleansing of the Palestinians from their land as possible, and refusing their return.

What Israelis and Palestinians alike need more than ever is a nonviolent civil rights movement that profoundly concurs with the Likud's official platform that the whole of Palestine, including the West Bank and Gaza, belong to Israel. Then, in the same way as what happened in the U.S. and South Africa, the movement should call for a democratic system of one man-one vote.

The state finds itself in this position: Having already ethnically cleansed and refused the return of 750,000 Palestinians now you have had to occupy more land in order to protect the land you have already stolen; and many of you have wanted to settle and expand into and steal this land as well. To adopt the simple and fundamental democratic Western principle of one man-one vote on both sides of the Jordan in all of Eretz Israel, that is, the dismantling of the ethnic cleansing and apartheid, would change this troubled and violence-ridden society, just as the apartheid-era South Africa and the Jim Crow South and the Confederacy were changed by Tutu and Mandela, and King and the American Civil Rights Movement, and Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's motto holds: "With malice toward none and charity for all."

Reflections in a Cypriot mirror
In another era, light years from the present, Israel was praised as an example of social progress and political creativity in a democracy that prospered under the most dire conditions. Yet the sharpest edge of criticism has been blunted by being cast into a familiar international mold - "the model of polarized societies."

In another era, light years from the present, Israel was praised as an example of social progress and political creativity in a democracy that prospered under the most dire conditions. True, the endless Israeli-Arab conflict and its violent fallout have somewhat dulled the shine on the success story and there has always been considerable criticism of ethnic discrimination and of the political, economic and social inequities faced by the Arab minority.

Yet the sharpest edge of this criticism has been blunted by being cast into a familiar international mold - "the model of polarized societies" - that made Israel just one society among many with "intercommunal disputes." These include the Catholics and Protestants of Northern Ireland, Maronites and Shi'ites in Lebanon, whites and blacks in South Africa, Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka, Greeks and Turks in Cyprus, Germans and Italians in southern Tyrol - and in Israel, Jews and Arabs.

The feeling that your troubles are shared by others provides a certain relief, and comparable causes or a common denominator create distance, making it easier to cope with painful dilemmas. In the mid-1980s this "comparative research" fad reached a peak. Intellectual arguments raged about models for "ethnic control" and "ethno-national disputes," as opposed to "wars of national liberation" or "colonialism," as opposed to "pluralist cleavages," and "apartheid" as opposed to "ethnic democracy." All the arguments just diverted attention from the slippery slope.

Starting in the late 1980s and on into the mid-1990s, dramatic developments were afoot in the realm of intercommunal disputes. As if a magic wand had been waved, they grew more moderate, so much so that many people began to believe they had finally been "resolved."

This was true of Lebanon, South Africa, Northern Ireland and even in Israel-Palestine, during the euphoric "Oslo" years. In the same way that the organic, endemic insolubility of the conflict was previously emphasized, now theories were expounded about the "point of ripeness" of the conflict. With that point reached, the road to a solution was open.

Although especially violent and barbaric ethnic conflicts persisted in Bosnia, Rwanda and Sri Lanka, their tides too were beginning to ebb. Permanent solutions were not reached in any of these societies - such solutions may be impossible - but in most of them, internal or external forces succeeded in realigning the dispute toward dialogue and crisis management. There have been signs of late that even the ancient conflicts that tore apart Cyprus and Sri Lanka are getting close to settlement, and that the rival sides have set out on the road of negotiation that will lead to agreement on models of autonomy and power sharing in government.

Not only does the Israeli-Palestinian conflict show no signs of temperance, but the opposite - intensification - is obvious in both its verbal and violent expression. Indeed, in the same way that in a different era Israel was seen as an example of progress, it has now become a symbol of an extremist, uncompromising state that has forsaken every universal norm concerning minority rights.

It is no accident that Israel is now a symbol for the most extremist groups fighting against compromise in Northern Ireland and in Cyprus. An Israeli flag flies proudly along the border of the Protestant zone in Northern Belfast, as a sign of defiant challenge - no concessions to Catholics.

The "foreign minister" of the Cypriot Turks joins Israelis who condemn "Oslo" and finds support from those Israelis who "have expressed their hope that a wall will someday divide them [from Palestinians], like that which runs across the island and slices the capital Nicosia in two - no concessions to Greeks, whose sole aim is seen as "Hellenization" of Turkish Cyprus, in the guise of a "right of return."

This identification with Israelis is no coincidence, just as it is no accident that only the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is deteriorating at a time when similar conflicts are becoming more moderate. Israel remains the only country in the Western world - maybe now in the whole world - that does not hesitate to create facts that are designed to make one ethnic group, the Jews, gain full control over the geophysical, political and cultural resources of the minority Arab national group. It even sees escalation of violence - in the guise of a "war on terror" - as a way to achieve the "absolute victory" of its ethnic objectives.

It is no wonder that compared to other ethno-national groups, which opted (willingly or grudgingly) for a rational approach inevitably leading to settling the disputes, Israel's defiant and confrontational approach is conspicuous.

There was a time when one could be comforted by the fact that Israel was not alone. Now, when the Turks and Greeks, Tamils and Sinalese, are all trying to settle their ancient and bloody conflicts, all eyes are focused on the anachronism of a country that professes to belong to the enlightened world, but permits itself to behave as if nothing has happened in the past generation. If the two sides on the neighboring island can reach agreement - or even dialogue - it will be impossible to bear the shame here any longer.

Corridors of Power / Assessing Arafat
Last week, Major General Amos Gilad gave a talk at the Middle East Media and Research Institute (MEMRI) in Jerusalem in which he offered his take on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority leader's intentions.

Last week, Major General Amos Gilad gave a talk at the Middle East Media and Research Institute (MEMRI) in Jerusalem in which he offered his take on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority leader's intentions.

While Gilad has said similar things on numerous occasions, both in public and in private, the way he delineated the situation this time made it clear that this issue ought to be at the center of the election campaign. Based on his long acquaintance with Arafat (Gilad was, among other things, the head of the research division in military intelligence and is currently Coordinator of Government Activity in the West Bank and Gaza), he asserted that it will never be possible to make peace with him.

Gilad believes that Arafat will not be satisfied with a two-state solution and that his true aim is "Greater Palestine" - a Palestinian state extending from the desert to the sea that would include Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, and even Jordan. According to Gilad, Arafat has not abandoned this vision despite his surprise at Israel's resilience in the face of the ongoing terror attacks.

Arafat was betting that the terror campaign he methodically prepared under the cover of the Oslo accords would erode Israel's bargaining ability and enable the Palestinians to dictate the terms of a final agreement. While he has been disillusioned in that regard, he still feels that he can defeat Israel by means of the Palestinians' demographic advantage, which will continue to eat away at the fabric of Israeli existence. This is why he has remained so insistent about the right of return.

Gilad says that at the Taba talks, the Palestinians were surprised by Israel's willingness to discuss, in principle, the refugees' return.

Gilad concluded by saying that while he doesn't know what kind of positions Arafat's successors will take, he knows for certain that peace cannot be achieved as long as Arafat is the Palestinian leader.

Gilad's assessment (which is shared by others in military intelligence) underlied the approach taken by the general staff in the past few years: It dictated former Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz's stance versus the PA and is key to the outlook of the current general staff. Of course, it also had a decisive influence on the approach taken by both Ehud Barak and Ariel Sharon to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Barak wanted to expose Arafat's true position and, by so doing, enhance Israeli understanding of the nature of the conflict. Sharon acts as if Barak's bitter experience only reinforces his known opinion of Arafat.

Both of them, and Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, managed the affairs of state in the past six years with the learned and professional opinion of Amos Gilad well in mind.

If the current election campaign really hinged on the existential issue of the future of the State of Israel in light of the conflict with the Palestinians, Gilad's view would have been at the center of the political discourse.

But the competition for the voter's hearts and minds is being waged not by politicians or ideologues, but by "strategic advisers," publicists and advertisers. And the latter bunch is causing this crucial debate to get drowned out by the din of corruption scandals, genuine and otherwise.

Lior Horev, a central figure in Sharon's campaign, has gone public with a complaint about alleged police scheming, unhesitatingly situating the Likud as a party doing battle with the law enforcement authorities (some Likud officials have been quoted as saying that the state is witness to "a conspiracy of the `rule of law' gang against the Likud").

Meanwhile, Labor has been accusing Sharon of Mafioso-like behavior without providing any decisive evidence of this.

In all the cacophony emanating from this election contest, the voter can hardly think straight.

Major General Gilad's insights ought to be a basis for the debate in which the outlooks of the right and left diverge. The right's conclusion is that Arafat's vision provides full justification for the view that says maintaining control of all the territories will serve as the main guarantee of the state's continued existence.

The left's conclusion is that separation from the West Bank and Gaza Strip is the formula for ensuring Israel's future; otherwise, it will either become an apartheid state or lose its Zionist identity.

The need to choose between these two paths grows more urgent by the day, but in the ten days left before the election, Israeli voters will not be given a decent opportunity to weigh the two possibilities. The parties will continue to distract the public from the main issue with all this extraneous clamor that dulls the senses and induces voter apathy or even despair.

Compromise still exists - in the polls
Most public opinion polls, both in Israel and in the territories, show that levels of support for compromise remain stable. The Israeli public, which is now leaning toward a vote for the right, is the same public that is willing, more than in the past, to agree to a Palestinian state and the dismantling of settlements.
By Danny Rubinstein	| Jan. 27, 2003 | 12:00 AM

From the Palestinian perspective, there is no realistic hope that the results of tomorrow's elections will lead to change. From their point of view, if there is any change, it will probably be for the worse. The chain of events is well known: As long as the intifada and violence continue, the right wing in Israel gets stronger and calls for harsher measures against the Palestinians grow louder and louder. On the Palestinian side, the picture is much the same. The tougher Israel's policy - the more assassinations, the more curfews, the more roadblocks - so the bitterness, frustration and lust for revenge grow and with them terrorist attacks.

However, alongside this vicious cycle exists another phenomenon, on both sides, which seems to be in complete contradiction to the escalation in violence. Most public opinion polls, both in Israel and in the territories, show that levels of support for compromise remain stable. The Israeli public, which is now leaning toward a vote for the right, is the same public that is willing, more than in the past, to agree to a Palestinian state and the dismantling of settlements.

Most of the Palestinian public still supports suicide bombings in Israel (although levels of support have dropped recently from 80 percent to 60 percent), but within the Palestinian public exists a willingness to recognize the state of Israel and agree to a two-state solution. When one asks pundits in the West Bank and Gaza to explain the contradiction, the answer is that support for terrorist attacks is not synonymous with support for the destruction of the state of Israel, but reflects support for the struggle against occupation. In other words, most of the Palestinian public is willing to recognize the state of Israel and live side by side with it, but supports a battle against occupation that means using terrorist attacks to hurt Israel as much as possible.

These findings beg the question, how can one translate the willingness for compromise that exists on both sides into something more concrete. Ami Ayalon, the former head of the Shin Bet, and Sari Nusseibeh, the president of Al Quds University, tried over recent months to promote the idea of popular endorsement of a peace document formulated by the two men. The idea was that if they were to manage to get hundreds of thousands of people on both sides to sign the document, it would be possible to present it to the leaders of both nations and demand that they give it their blessing.

In Israel almost no one has heard of the idea, while on the Palestinian side it has run into difficulties. Nusseibeh was given an angry welcome when he appeared last week before students at Al-Najah University in Nablus. Now, a group of Palestinian academics and intellectuals, among them Dr. Haider a-Shafi from Gaza, are trying to get several dozen non-politically active Palestinians to sign a joint document with Israelis calling for two states based on the 1967 borders.

These initiatives seem for the moment to be unlikely to succeed as circumstances on the ground are working against them. One example is the way in which the idea of separation is being implemented with a fence going up between Israel and the territories (the apartheid fence, the Palestinians call it). The fence, which does not run along the Green Line, prevents free movement for both sides and of course leaves the Jewish settlers in the territories.

The fence also means that the only Jewish presence in Hebron, Ramallah and Nablus is of Jewish fanatics guarded by battalions of soldiers and border police. The Israeli government has for several years placed obstacles in the path of Israelis such as Peace Now members who wish to demonstrate, for example, in Hebron. Thus the only Jews remaining in Hebron are Baruch Marzel and his cronies, who day after day call for the transfer of the city's Arabs.

Troubled Chelsea adrift in a sea of conspiracies
The real dramas at English Premier League club Chelsea FC are far from their Stamford Bridge ground in west London.
By Yossi Melman	| Jan. 29, 2003 | 12:00 AM

The real dramas at English Premier League club Chelsea FC are far from their Stamford Bridge ground in west London.

Those dramas in the dealings of the club take place in board rooms of companies, some with shady reputations, in tax havens and at casinos, some on land and others aboard ships.

They rear their head in criminal cases that have sent shock waves all the way from Britain to South Africa, the U.S., Egypt, Libya and even reaching Israel. Indeed, even the Mossad and Cyril Kern find their way into this story.

Chelsea, which was founded in 1905, is currently identified very strongly with its outspoken chairman, Ken Bates, who bought a controlling interest in the club in 1982 at a very attractive price - only 1 million pounds.

In 1996 Bates floated his club on the London Stock Exchange and raised its value to 200 million pounds. For a while, things were looking good, but lately it has not been so rosy at Stamford Bridge, with losses of almost 10 million pounds in 2001 and debts totaling tens of millions of pounds. Indeed, the club's very existence is in doubt as Bates and his helpers look desperately to find a buyer.

Recently it has been alleged that the debts result not from poor management; rather, they can be blamed on various alleged con artists.

A group of Chelsea supporters are fearful that the club really is on the verge of collapse and that Bates and his secret group of partners only want the stadium as a piece of real estate, since it is situated in one of the most expensive locations in the whole of Europe.

The group, which calls itself the Chelsea Action Group (CAG), claims to continue the legacy of Matthew Harding, a former club shareholder and supporter who poured millions of his own fortune into the club and who was killed in a helicopter accident several years ago. Their web site address is www.chelseaactiongroup.com

One of the key players in this story is a South African businessman named Stanley Tollman. Born in 1930, by the age of 40 Tollman was considered to be one of the biggest real estate and hotel magnates during the apartheid years.

In 1970 he built the Johannesburg Towers Hotel, one of the most exclusive hotels in South Africa, but five years later he was broke. He moved to Europe and took ownership of a commercial and residential skyscraper complex in Monte Carlo where he met Bates.

The two became business partners and soon Tollman set up a small travel agency in London - Trafalgar Travel - for Bates.

After Bates bought Chelsea in 1982, he invited Tollman onto the club's board and Trafalgar Travel's executives were regular visitors in the directors' box at Stamford Bridge.

In 1984 Tollman and a partner named Monty Hundley bought a chain of low-price motels called Days Inn in the U.S. The chain cost $765 million and was financed mainly through bank loans.

Tollman supposedly left the Chelsea board in 1992 but lately he appears to have reappeared in a crucial role. The long-standing friendship between Tollman and Bates is still strong (Bates even called his dog Tollie).

In 1993 Bates and Tollman set up a company called Chelsea Village which itself established many subsidiaries in various tax havens around the world. Those companies moved money around among themselves.

The Chelsea Village company, which also owns the soccer club, continued to operate even after the club's shares were floated in London and suspicions are now beginning to fly that after the flotation, anonymous parties took all the money and effectively left the club penniless.

One of Bates' and Tollman's partners in the Chelsea Village company is a man called Marwan Ashraf, 58, who is married to Mona, the third daughter of former Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. Ashraf held a senior position in Nasser's regime and he was also close to Anwar Sadat.

Ha'aretz recently revealed that according to foreign publications, Marwan Ashraf has been a senior Mossad agent since 1969 and he provided his operators early warning of the Yom Kippur War.

Eli Zeira, who was then head of IDF Military Intelligence, and who was found by the Agranat Commission to be one of those most responsible for not knowing that the war was going to break out, claimed that Ashraf was a double agent and he tricked his Israeli operators.

Ashraf left for London and went into business. Today he divides his time between London and Cairo and among other things, he guides Western entrepreneurs to invest their money in Arab countries and directs Arab funds for investment in the West.

Media speculation has also tied him to Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi, claiming that he serves as his financial adviser.

The CAG claims that Gadhafi is a partner of Ashraf's, who himself has a 3-percent stake in Chelsea.

The Gadhafi family, who are well-known soccer fans, have already shown an interest in Italian soccer and have connections with giant Juventus. Gadhafi's son is active in the Libyan FA and is known to have little patience with unsuccessful coaches.

Meanwhile Tollman has also taken a controlling interest in a company named Alpha which runs floating casinos. These ships are a way to avoid local gambling laws along the Mississippi River and on Indian reserves in Florida.

Tollman and his wife, Beatrice, have accumulated an enormous personal fortune which includes a farm in Connecticut, an exclusive luxury apartment overlooking Central Park and a palace in Palm Beach.

Beatrice runs their five hotels in the UK and the couple, who own a fleet of Rolls Royce cars and private aircraft, soon found themselves living it up with the Palm Beach "jet set."

The Tollmans were considered to be the hottest property at Christmas and New Year's parties in Palm Beach. Tollman is also known to be a major contributor to the Republican Party.

The high life did not last for long, however, and in the late 1990s the U.S. authorities opened a criminal investigation on suspicion that the purchase of the Days Inn chain was done by defrauding the banks.

In April 2002 Tollman was convicted on 33 counts of embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion. The trial revealed that Tollman extracted $42 million by fraudulent means from U.S. banks. When he declared himself to be in financial difficulties, Tollman was in fact transferring the money to shell companies in Europe.

Tollman did not turn up for the trial and took refuge in the UK while the U.S. authorities apply for an extradition order.

So how is all this connected to Israel?

Two weeks ago Ha'aretz broke the story of Cyril Kern's $1.5 million loan to the Sharon family. The South African media began looking into Kern's dealings, and the Mail and Guardian newspaper revealed a connection between Kern and Tollman which Kern admitted. He said that a relative had introduced him to Tollman.

"I have met him, but he is not a friend and I have no business or personal connection with him," Kern said.

Kern refused to answer questions posed by Ha'aretz about the matter and said he would not even be prepared to listen to questions about the man.

New fence plan irks left, right
By Nadav Shragai	| Feb. 5, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
There were harsh reactions from both left and right to the map presented to Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz this week by the Yesha Council of Settlements as an alternative to the separation fence route already partially approved by the government.

Peace Now called on the government to reject the proposed route, saying "the proposal to annex hundreds of thousands of Palestinians will turn Israel into an apartheid state. The proposed fence has nothing to do with security considerations and its purpose is to perpetuate the conflict and annex the West Bank." Peace Now called for the separation fence to be placed on the Green Line.

Tekuma, a party in the right-wing National Union bloc, also condemned the route, saying "any fence that does not surround Arab cities that export terror is a political map and not a security fence. There are only two ways to fight terror: to restore the IDF's deterrent power or to dig in behind useless fences. It's too bad the Yesha Council is being dragged along by petty politicians."

The map given to Mofaz is closer to Areas A and B, and leaves dozens of otherwise isolated settlements on the western side of the fence, but also leaves dozens on the eastern side of the fence. The Yesha Council called it a "security fence" and not a "political fence." It in effect annexes at least another 110,000 Palestinians by putting them on the western side of putative fence.

Negative flashback
Confronting less pleasant aspects of our past is something we have to do, says print gallery owner and archivist Vivienne Silver-Brody. And that, she says, can be done through photography.
By David Rapp	Feb. 7, 2003 | 12:00 AM

In the annals of the Zionist movement, it was journalist Theodor Herzl who first understood the importance of the photo-op. When the German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, planned a trip to the Holy Land in the late 19th century to attend the dedication of the new Church of the Redeemer in Jerusalem's Old City, Herzl sent him an album of photographs of the nascent Jewish community in Palestine. Along with the album, he sent a letter seeking an audience with the emperor. On October 29, 1898, they met at Mikveh Israel, and the photograph of the encounter was published all over the world.

Those who want to believe that the Zionist movement was born in deceit can cite this photograph. David Wolffson, Herzl's assistant, who had taken the snap, discovered, on developing the film, that the picture had not come out. With Herzl's knowledge, a photomontage was made, reconstructing the historic event.

In the decades that followed, photography played an important role in the Zionist propaganda effort. Pictures were taken documenting immigration and the founding of settlements, building up the myth of the Jew returning to his homeland and working the soil. Alongside the commissioned photographers, there were also ordinary photographers in Palestine who were not working for major organizations like the Jewish National Fund and the Jewish Agency.

One of the photographers in Tel Aviv in the 1920s was Arnold Zylberschlag, the proprietor of Photo Roshem on Rothschild Street. The Zylberschlags arrived from Poland in 1924. Arnold also opened a factory that manufactured buckets, but was forced to close down, unable to compete with imports from Britain. The family returned to Europe in 1927.

Three generations

In those years, the Goldfarb family owned a photography studio in Kielce, Poland called Fotografia Art Rembrandt. A son of the Zylberschlags and a daughter of the Goldfarbs met at the studio in Poland and married in 1932. Eventually, the couple settled in Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe). A daughter, named Vivienne, was born to them in 1942 - the third generation of a family of photographers on both sides. Vivienne received her first camera at the age of five, and has been snapping pictures ever since.

Vivienne Silver-Brody, who immigrated to Israel in 1971, established a photographic print gallery which has been open to the public for 17 years, first in Jerusalem, and now in Ein Hod. On the door of the gallery in Ein Hod hang photographs of her family's photography shops in Tel Aviv and Poland. Over the years, Silver-Brody has made efforts to trace the history of her family, which lost many members in the Holocaust.

After moving to Israel, she began to search for her roots in a broader sense, which could explain her attraction to the history of Jewish photography in Eretz Israel. In the Jewish artists' village Ein Hod, built on the ruins of the abandoned Arab village of Ein Houd, she has spent years researching a history that she says Israeli society and the local art world have done little to preserve.

The Silver Print gallery is now showing photographs of women and children taken from the 19th century until today. Women and children are the real "others." In the early 20th century, "enlisted" photographers took photos of Arabs, in an effort to emphasize the Jews' good neighborly relations with the local residents. The current exhibit focuses on those whose exposure to the lens has always been minimal.

As a child, Silver-Brody saw how people treated "the other." Growing up in Rhodesia and visiting nearby South Africa, she was a witness to apartheid at its most extreme. Her parents were also affected by these discriminatory practices.

"In the early 1930s, my parents lived in Poland, near the German border," she relates. "When the Nazis came to power, they realized it was time to leave. My father traveled around Europe and bought a plot of land in Cyprus. In the end, he persuaded my mother to come with him to South Africa. A few weeks after they arrived, the country introduced new immigration laws." So the couple got on a train and left Capetown for Bulawayo, Rhodesia, where Vivienne was born. Her father opened a photography shop and specialized in portraits.

Years later, when Rhodesia was shaken by internal conflict, the father tried to persuade his wife and two daughters to move again, this time to Cyprus. In the end, they remained in Rhodesia, where the father died in 1974, a few months before the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, resulting in his property on the island losing its value.

Vivienne was already living in Israel by this time, working for Tel Aviv University, where she established a photo archive. To pursue her studies in the history of photography, she went to the United States. On her return, she says, she made up her mind to follow in the footsteps of American photographer Alfred Steiglitz, who "opened the eyes of the American public to photography as an art form."

Steiglitz, they say, used to do background checks on clients who purchased prints from his galleries, to make sure that his work went to "good homes." Silver-Brody wanted her prints to end up in good homes, too, but she soon realized that in Israel, the problem is finding buyers to begin with.

"Israel doesn't have a tradition of collecting prints or hanging them in private homes," she says. "Not only does the public know nothing about many fascinating photographers who were active here in the past, but even photography students have never seen their work."

Silver-Brody began to delve into the legacy of photography in this country. She collected photographs from old archives and estates that no one had touched for years. Five years ago, she published a book entitled "Documenters of the Dream: Pioneer Jewish Photographers in the Land of Israel, 1890-1933."

In 2000, Silver-Brody curated an exhibit at the Mane Katz Museum: "From Mirror to Memory: A Hundred Years of Photography in the Land of Israel." The new millennium was the pretext for an almost impossible mission: summing up a century of photographic activity. Silver-Brody wondered how to present the society living in this country in all its different faces.

"At the beginning of the century, there were lots of photographic sources: Christian organizations, missionaries, pilgrims, Armenians, Jews, Arabs. But during certain periods, there is hardly any material, especially for the Arab sector in the 1930s and `40s and after the establishment of the state."

To fill in the blanks, Silver-Brody turned to amateur photography. "I made the rounds of Arab villages, Druze families and Christian schools, and discovered a real treasure trove," she says. These snapshots - among them pictures of a dance performance at the Italian school for girls in Haifa and the baptism of a newborn infant - were hung alongside the professional photographs at the exhibition. "I tried to include Muslim and Christian society in the documentation of events. As time goes on, it gets harder to find this kind of material."

Indeed, the store of photographs of interest to researchers is incomplete in a society that knowingly denies segments of its past - even events which have been documented. The archives of important photographers, among them Khalil Raad, are in Beirut, and the American Colony archives are in Washington. Silver-Brody says that Israel expressed no interest when the American Colony collection was put up for sale in the 1980s.

"Even the material we do have hasn't been sufficiently researched," says Silver-Brody, "and when research is inadequate, it's impossible to reach conclusions about what happened here. It takes courage, but confronting the past is something we have to do, and that includes the less pleasant aspects. One of the ways to do it is through photography."

Silver-Brody is one of the few people who hunt down such material and organize it for showing to the public, but she is cautious when it comes to conclusions. She is reluctant, for example, to label the major trends in Zionist photography at the beginning of the century "enlisted art."

"Most of the photographers who documented the realization of the Zionist dream believed in it themselves," she says. "The subjects may have been commissioned, but that doesn't mean the photographers were hired lackeys. If photography back then was `enlisted,' then what can you say about today, when money and boosting sales are the sacred values?

"We are talking about raw material," says Silver-Brody, when she talks about the history of the photography in "Eretz Israel." The same holds true for the current exhibit of photographs documenting women and children. "This show has no message whatsoever," she writes in a flyer distributed to visitors. "It is not political or feminist. It is simply a collection of quality photographs that explores one subject."

On one wall hangs a photograph that leaves the spectator feeling uneasy. It depicts an "Oriental" woman from the beginning of the century wearing traditional garb and laden with jewelry - a kind of anthropological exhibit. A modern equivalent might be those exotic pictures of "primitive," half-naked women, chiefly non-Western, taken in the interests of touristic documentation, without anyone asking their opinion.

Another photograph from the end of the 19th century shows a man driving a wagon in which his veiled wives are sitting. A rare photograph from the early 20th century shows the women's section of the Western Wall. On the stones one discerns the names of visitors, clearly marked in ink. This graffiti was later erased, on the orders of the British.

Next to an almost surrealistic photograph by Werner Braun, "Nuns Enjoying an Outing in the Valley of the Cross," hangs Boris Carmi's "Woman Officer," taken in 1948. Over the years, this has been one of the gallery's most popular prints. It seems to fit in with people's expectations of how the new Jewish woman should look.

"The tree that the soldier is leaning against, and the way that her body seems to repeat the shape of the tree, with its deep roots, is a symbol of the Zionist dream in all its glory," says Silver-Brody.

On closer inspection, one spies a number on the arm of a soldier in the foreground - taking the viewer back to the horrors and humiliation of the war. Not many notice this disturbing detail. Which goes to show that bringing these photographs to the public is not sufficient, even with heaps of commentary on the side. There has to be a public that is willing to take a closer look.

S. Africa steps up diplomacy on Iraq disarmament offer
By Reuters	| Feb. 15, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
CAPE TOWN - South Africa, interposing itself in an increasingly bitter debate over Iraq, said Saturday it was convinced its offer to share its expertise on disarmament with Baghdad could help avert war.

South Africa's offer, confirmed by President Thabo Mbeki in his state-of-the-nation speech on Friday, involves sending to Iraq a team of experts who led South Africa's own voluntary disarmament programme after the end of apartheid in 1994.

Mbeki said Iraq had accepted the offer and that the team, set to include specialists in chemical, biological and nuclear disarmament, would be sent shortly.

The diplomatic initiative comes as Pretoria takes the lead among developing nations in opposing a possible U.S. attack on Iraq, which it says would lead to economic disaster for Africa.

Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said the South Africans would assist Iraq with the mechanics of cooperating with UN weapons inspectors - which he believed they were willing to do.

"We have no reason to question that," Pahad told reporters. "We are not presuming that they have weapons or they don't have weapons. It's a process of exchange of ideas while the inspectors carry out their task."

Pahad said South Africa's proposal had been put to members of the UN Security Council, including the United States and Britain, and had received "no negative response".

He said the South African team would include officials from the former apartheid government who helped build - and then destroy - the country's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.

The South African offer came as the United States and Britain suffered a setback in the United Nations, where top UN arms officials on Friday held out the hope that arms inspections were working.

Pahad said South Africa, too, believed inspectors should be given more time, although he conceded the process should not be indefinite.

He said signs of Iraqi cooperation were promising, including its new ban on weapons of mass destruction and its permitting surveillance flights by U2 spy planes.

"There's a general concept that there have been quite substantial moves in trying to tackle the concerns of the Security Council," Pahad said. "Nothing supports the idea that we should go to war to achieve disarmament."

Not so simple to protest the war
The anti-Israel tone of current peace demonstrations raises a dilemma for American Jews.
By Nathan Guttman	| Feb. 17, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Ever since the 1960s, American Jews have been an inseparable part of the protest movement against war and for peace. Although this has not always been the official position of the Jewish establishment in the United States, the Jewish presence in the protest movements far exceeded their relative weight in the U.S. population.

The impending war in the Gulf is indicating for the first time that there is a fracture between American Jews and the opponents of war. Jewish activists who have been following the demonstrations and protest activities since last summer, cannot help but notice their evident anti-Israel line. Alongside the placards and exhortations against President George W. Bush, there are always placards attacking Israel and the occupation of the territories. Moreover, speakers at the demonstrations have often mentioned Israel as one of the key factors (alongside oil and his inheritance from his father) that are impelling President Bush to wage war against Iraq.

One of the reasons for this is that the main organization in the coalition of protest movements is ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War & End Racism), which has always had an aggressive anti-Israeli line. In its publications, the organization depicts Israel as "the other apartheid."

ANSWER's policy and the consistent anti-Israeli line in the protest demonstrations has caused a considerable number of American Jews who are against the war to stay away. Even those who have wanted to participate are not always welcome. Last week, Jewish leftist activist Rabbi Michael Lerner experienced this personally.

Rabbi Lerner, editor of the leftist Jewish periodical Tikkun and a severe critic of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government, was supposed to have spoken at an anti-war demonstration in San Francisco. Lerner, who is against a military campaign in Iraq, attacked ANSWER for "exploiting the demonstrations against the war to promote anti-Israeli propaganda." In an e-mail message he sent out after his appearance was canceled, Lerner stated that the organizers boycotted him because he refused to accept this policy. He wrote that he had intended to speak against the war but also against the anti-Semitism in the protest movement, and therefore he was not allowed to speak.

In the demonstrations last weekend, one Jewish speaker stood out in New York. This was Ruth Messinger, a veteran peace activist and formerly a Democratic candidate for mayor of New York. She herself also expressed reservations about the anti-Israeli line of the protest demonstrations, but said that she recognizes the fact that protest coalitions are made up of a variety of organizations with different agendas.

The Jewish establishment, through the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA), which constitutes a kind of political umbrella organization for Jewish bodies, has begun to act in recent weeks to change the tone in the protest organizations. JCPA representatives have contacted the various organizations, local and national, and have asked them to distinguish between protest against the war and protest against Israel and thus enable Jews and supporters of Israel to participate in the anti-war events. Response to this request has thus far been partial.

Ex-security chiefs present Israeli side of conflict in S. Africa
By Charlotte Hall	| Feb. 19, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
An Israeli delegation of former high-ranking security officials returned from Cape Town on Wednesday following four days of intensive talks with senior South African government and security officials, including those who served in the military wing of the ANC and the security establishment of the Apartheid government.

Four South African cabinet ministers were joined at the meeting by former and serving military and intelligence officers, who told the Israeli delegation about their experience of negotiations, peacemaking and the transition to democracy, says South African government spokeswoman Lorna Daniels.

South African president Thabo Mbeki also joined the final session of the four-day meet Monday, where he pledged to intensify his government's efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The nine-strong unofficial Israeli delegation included former chief of staff and transport minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, former Northern District Police commander Alik Ron, Major General (Res.) Danny Rothschild and General (Res.) Uri Simhoni. Israeli military and security officials currently serving in the army and in government, were also invited by the South African government, but did not attend.

Rothschild said he felt by the end of the four days, the South African delegation "understood there are two sides to the coin" in the Arab-Israeli conflict. "We explained to them in detail that if they really wanted to take part in the peace process in the Middle East - as they say - they need to learn a lot and not take as fact what they hear from each side," he continued.

South African government spokeswoman Daniels agreed that the South Africans left the meetings with a better understanding of how Israelis view the conflict and the obstacles they face. She added that the interaction was helped by "the frank and constructive atmosphere." One inside source said it was the first time the former military leadership of the ANC, which has a historical affinity with the PLO, had met with senior Israelis.

The meeting, hosted by the South African government, was based at the Spier Wine Estate outside Stellenbosch near Cape Town. It grew up of a retreat at the same location a year ago, where Israeli peace activists and Palestinian Authority officials met for three days of intensive talks with President Mbeki and senior officials in the South African government.

Then too, discussions focused on the South African experience of conflict resolution and lessons that could be useful in the Middle East context.

Palestinians urge sanctions against Israel
By Reuters	| Feb. 22, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
KUALA LUMPUR - A senior Palestinian official urged the Non-Aligned Movement on Saturday to use its influence in the United Nations to win the imposition of sanctions against Israel.

Israeli forces have carried out a series of armoured raids into the Gaza Strip in the past week, killing many Palestinians in attacks that have overshadowed new international peace efforts and roused fresh Palestinian fury.

"We expect more terrorism in this part of the world," Farouq al-Qaddoumi, head of the political directorate in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, said on the sidelines of a summit of the 114 members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.

Asked what NAM's members, who account for about two-thirds of the United Nations, could achieve at their three-yearly summit, al-Qaddoumi suggested sanctions to force Israel to give up what the Palestinians call "terrorism" against their people.

"NAM countries represent two-thirds of the countries of the world and have to shoulder the task in the UN of trying to impose sanctions - as they were imposed on the apartheid regime in South Africa," he said.

He did not give details of what type of sanctions he would want the developing nations - mainly from Africa, the Middle East and Asia - that comprise NAM to demand.

At this summit, South Africa is handing over chairmanship of the movement to Malaysia.

It was not clear whether the summit would take up such a call during a meeting dominated by discussion on how to tackle weapons of mass destruction, particularly the U.S. threat of war on Iraq and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

NAM calls for Iraq disarmament without war Members of the Non-Aligned Movement called Saturday for Iraq to surrender any weapons of mass destruction but the countries that account for two-thirds of the United Nations rejected war as the means to disarmament.

Opening their three-yearly ministerial meeting in the Malaysian capital, NAM members said there was no question that Iraq must comply with UN resolutions but they strongly opposed any U.S.-led war against Iraq.

"Iraq must be disarmed if it possesses weapons of mass destruction, but the question is how best to achieve it," said South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-zuma.

"We believe that it is possible and desireable that we do this through peaceful means," she said. "We must assert the centrality of the United Nations in settling such matters."

The issue of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and North Korea has dominated the run-up to a two-day summit Monday and Tuesday of leaders of the 114-member NAM.

The United States and Britain are massing 150,000 troops on Iraq's border, threatening war unless President Saddam Hussein surrenders alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.

Foreign ministers from NAM are set later Saturday to approve a resolution that "categorically rejects the current threat of war".

Iraq seized the opportunity to lobby furiously for support to counter the United States in the final declaration.

"We hope this statement truly expresses the feelings of the peoples of NAM, totally rejecting the idea of aggression, hegemony and war planned by Washington," Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri told reporters.

But the tone of the gathering did not go entirely Iraq's way.

The grouping, which includes Iran, Iraq and North Korea - the three states branded by U.S. President George W. Bush as an "axis of evil" - has rejected a request by Baghdad to deny Washington use of their soil for any Middle East war.

Ministers have been fiercely critical of the United States, with several in their speeches taking swipes at what they called "the unilateral use of force".

Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said the growing influence of "just one superpower" had brought the world to the brink of conflict:

"A conflict which the peoples of the world have loudly and clearly opposed," he said, adding that the collective voice of the global majority had said "no to war".

Iraq has welcomed the support it has received from the movement that was founded during the Cold War as a counterweight to the Eastern and Western blocs.

Baghdad says it is doing everything it can to cooperate with UN inspectors combing the country for weapons.

Ministers have said the UN inspectors, headed by Hans Blix, should be given ample time to make a proper assessment and not coaxed into accelerating the drive to war.

U.S. ally Pakistan was among those opposed to war and willing to consider more time for UN inspections, but insisted that Iraq must comply with United Nations resolutions on disarming.

"All means must be found to avoid war, if that means more time has to be given to the inspectors," Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told reporters. "And there's that report from Mr Blix, let's wait for that report."

Members have stressed the weight of NAM's views.

United Arab Emirates envoy Mohamad Jassam reminded the United States that six non-aligned countries currently have seats on the 15-member UN Security Council and that nine votes would be enough to kill a resolution.

The six non-aligned nations on the Security Council are Angola, Guinea, Syria, Pakistan, Chile and Cameroon.

Malaysia expects 56 heads of state to attend the two-day summit, with several Middle East nations sending substitutes due to uncertainty over the timing of an emergency Arab Summit in Egypt to discuss the Iraq crisis.

No consensus on North Korea Apparent agreement over the question of war with Iraq was not matched by consensus on the North Korean nuclear crisis.

Pyongyang was set to snub the group by sticking to its position that it would discuss its nuclear ambitions with the United States alone and disagreeing with requests from its 113 fellow members that it reconsider its decision to quit the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

The working group on disarmament failed to win North Korea's agreement to a statement opposing Pyongyang's decision last month to withdraw from the NPT and moved instead to raise the deadlock to a higher level, an Indonesian delegate said.

Poverty-stricken communist North Korea has kicked out weapons inspectors and left the NPT, saying it needs nuclear arms and wants to discuss the crisis with the United States. Washington says it will hold multilateral talks.

International law has clearly formulated rules as to the conduct of armed conflicts by states, and these rules are set out in the hundreds of regulations detailed in various treaties, including those in the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, on the question as to when a state may use force in its international relations, international law is vague, and the answer is contained only in a few generalized principles.

The United Nations Charter outlaws the use of force between states, and it is claimed that this is now a rule of customary international law - if so, it is, in Hamlet's words, "a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance." The UN Charter language forbids "the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." This choice of language leaves open the interpretation that use of force is permitted, if it is in furtherance of the purposes of the UN.

The UN Charter also states that "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs." In regard to the possible attack against Iraq, the U.S. claim is, inter alia, that it exercised a right of self-defense against Iraq's attacks on Israel, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and that in light of Iraq's threats and behavior, that right of self-defense continues to be valid. International law permits a state to act in self-defense not only when it itself is attacked but also when, at the request of an attacked state, it comes to the aid of that state. Self-defense can be activated in response to preliminary activity of an attack, and a state is not required to wait passively until bombs actually fall. It is claimed that states are even entitled to take preemptive action to frustrate a possible attack though this interpretation is controversial.

In addition to the right of self-defense, international law recognizes that states are entitled to act out of necessity. Necessity can allow states to take actions, including the use of force, which, if it were not for such necessity, would be violations of international law. Such action is permitted in order to prevent a more serious violation of international law that would affect a vital interest of the state. An example of such action was the British Royal Air Force's bombing of the oil tanker Torrey Canyon. The ship broke up off the English coast, and if it hadn't been destroyed, it would have caused immense ecological harm. Another example came, in 1965, when Israel shelled the Syrian tractors working on the Arab diversion program intended to deprive Israel of the use of the waters of the river Jordan. There was no armed attack by Syria against Israel, but Israel's action was a clear case of necessity.

Since Iraq has not complied with Security Council decisions on disarming its weapons of mass destruction, U.S. action to disarm Iraq could well be considered as an act of necessity. It is problematic whether U.S. action aimed at replacing the Iraqi regime could also come under this rubric. Actions by states involving the right of self-defense or acts of necessity do not require Security Council approval.

Beyond the rights of states to self-defense and necessity, the UN Charter grants the Security Council powers of activating collective security when the Council determines that there has occurred an act of "aggression," a "threat to the peace" or a "breach of the peace." This right of collective security is, in fact, a modern application of the principle of the balance of power dating back to Metternich and the 1815 Congress of Vienna and its nexus to international law is purely formal. Because of the right of veto granted to the five permanent members of the Council, there has been scarce use of collective security measures and there have been no Security Council resolutions taking mandatory measures regarding the numerous armed conflicts that have taken place since the foundation of the UN.

Claims are heard that the international law applies a double standard as regards Iraq's non-compliance with Security Council resolutions compared with that applied to Israel. Such claims ignore a basic principle of the UN Charter as regards Security Council decisions. According to the Charter the only Council decisions that are binding are those adopted under Chapter VII, which deals with a determination that there has been aggression or a threat or breach of the peace. All other decisions have the status of recommendations. The decisions as regards Iraq were adopted under Chapter VII, and are mandatory, but since 1948 no decision as regards the Arab-Israel conflict has been adopted under Chapter VII. All the numerous decisions, including Security Council Resolution 242, had the status of recommendations and of course the question of violating them does not arise.

I will not participate in my upcoming reserve duty

For over 35 years, using its military might, Israel has been occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. About 3.5 million Palestinians are under its occupation. An entire nation has been marked as the enemy. Millions of people, different from one another, have been painted in the Israeli consciousness in colors of terror and inhumanity, to make it easier for us to justify our behavior, to continue to avert our glance - mainly so we can continue to be occupiers.

But these people, the subjects of the occupation, are not abstract figures. I saw the two teenage boys who were taken from the yard of their house, handcuffed, kneeling in the deep mud. I saw an older man struggling with his trembling lower lip, in order not to cry after 19-year-old soldiers decided to educate him, and to delay him at the checkpoint for an entire day. I saw a woman, on a particularly cold and rainy winter day, swaddling her baby and waiting, ID card in hand, until the soldier had time to motion to her with his finger to approach for a check. I knew the man whose nephew was killed because soldiers chose him to serve as a human shield for them. I spoke to people who called an ambulance to evacuate the wounded and the sick, but it didn't arrive because our forces prevented its passage. I met the family that collected rainwater all winter, until someone in the Civil Administration decided to destroy the reservoir, since they had no permits. I read the words of the man who was forced to evacuate the body of his neighbor, and the story of the old wife of the village idiot, whom everyone knew and pitied, until he was shot by soldiers.

I can only be ashamed and try to protest. Occupation, any occupation, depends on the willingness of soldiers to maintain it. I know that many soldiers, in the standing army and in the reserves, are still willing to carry out their orders; to continue to believe, despite what they see with their own eyes, that repression can lead to victory. I won't be among them. I refuse to be an active partner to what is being done in my name in any case.

There are deeds that are unforgivable. We will all have to answer for the killing of civilians, the mass destruction of homes, the curfew, the humiliation and the starvation; for the policy of apartheid that distinguishes between the Jewish master and his Palestinian subject; for the out-and-out racism and the hard-heartedness.

I have been working in a human rights organization for about a year-and-a-half. In my work, I am exposed daily to Israel's routinely negative conduct in the territories. I am witness to the military's mobilization for carrying out and preparing these deeds. In the course of my work, I frequently travel to the occupied territories, learn at first-hand about the situation I have described, and try to change it. I won't go to those places in uniform.

Austria's effort

Regarding the opinion piece "Vienna doesn't care any more" by Adar Primor, March 10:

I very much appreciate your interest in political events in Vienna and do agree with many aspects of your analysis, in particular regarding the outcome of the last parliamentary elections in Austria and the achievements of the previous Austrian government, which "did more than any other government to deal with its past."

In this context, I would like to add that Austria has indeed successfully intensified its efforts to come to grips with Austrians' involvement in crimes of the Nazi terror regime and to urgently address remaining restitution payments to victims.

Back in 1998, Austria established an international historians' commission, which recently presented its final report on the seizure of property on Austrian territory under the Nazis and restitution since 1945. Furthermore, Austria is very much obligated to human rights education and to pass on to its young generation the devastating truth of the darker period in its history, the Holocaust. Among the central aspects of this educational program are regular visits of Austrian schoolteachers to Yad Vashem.

On the other hand, I cannot but stress that neither the Austrian government nor this embassy share Mr. Sichrovsky's assessment as contained in the last paragraph of Primor's article and used in the headline "Vienna doesn't care anymore."

Throughout the past two years - while political relations have been strained - we have continuously aimed at improving bilateral relations between Austria and Israel, inter alia in the cultural, economic and social fields.

We will continue to further address this great and promising potential with a view to establishing cordial relations between our two countries and peoples. Full diplomatic relations - with an Ambassador of the State of Israel in Austria - are an important prerequisite in this regard.

Alert bars Israeli Arabs from J'lem tunnel road
By Yair Ettinger	| Mar. 14, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Arabs were prevented from using the tunnel road south of Jerusalem yesterday after an alert warning of a possible terrorist attack from the Judea area aided by Israeli Arabs.

Soldiers prevented Arab travelers from crossing the checkpoint in the south of the capital. Like Jewish travelers, many Arabs use the road on their way to and from the Negev; others use it for trips to Bethlehem and Hebron. But Arabs, including some Israeli Arabs, were left at the checkpoint yesterday when soldiers only allowed Jews to use the tunnel road.

The IDF Spokesman's Office confirmed that "as a result of information about the possibility of a terrorist operation aided by Israeli Arabs, it was decided to prevent the use of the road for a few hours by Israeli Arabs." The office said the orders were dropped after a few hours.

MK Azmi Bishara, chairman of Balad, charged "the move brings the racist political culture to the level of official apartheid."

Fair balance

Regarding "Eitan, Bar-On slam justice appointment process" by Gideon Alon, March 25:

In his article, Gideon Alon sheds much needed light on the Supreme Court in Israel, which wields tremendous power, yet does not represent both sides of the political spectrum. Here in the U.S., the federal and supreme courts are made up of judges who were nominated and appointed by presidents who were conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican, so there is a mixture of conservatives and liberals on the bench, who each reflect the majority of the population who elected those administrations. That is why we now have a conservative attorney general, John Ashcroft, who is deeply religious and very strong and aggressive in dealing with the threat of terrorism America now faces. It is undemocratic and shameful that the entire court system and Ministry of Justice in Israel is made up exclusively of secular, liberal judges and officials, who do not reflect the majority of the population who voted for a conservative government. Why are conservatives not represented in the Israeli court system, and civil and state administrations, for that matter, as they are in every other democratic country?

Orwellian double-speak

Regarding "Smart bombs, obtuse commentators" by Gideon Levy, March 23:

I should just like to express my profound respect for the sentiments expressed by your correspondent Gideon Levy. If only others could match the degree of understanding and empathy shown by him, the world would be a much better and safer place. The sooner more people can think in this way, the sooner we will stop being harangued by the Orwellian double-speak of leaders like George Bush, spouting that we "Go to war in the name of peace," with innocent children suffering from the consequences of these words. Perhaps then we can start to alleviate the plight of those we can help, instead of prolonging their suffering.

WHO's `health apartheid' for Taiwan

Regarding "Mysterious pneumonia is becoming worldwide health threat, WHO warns" by A

According to its constitution, the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) is "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health." However, this noble spirit of the constitution has been compromised and the name of this professional medical organization thus tarnished, as not all peoples are under its protection umbrella.

The WHO now has listed 192 members, two associate members (Puerto Rico and Tokelau) and 29 areas (including Hong Kong and Macao and places like the Cook Islands and the Falkland Islands) on its Web site's (www.who.int/ith/indexofcountries.html) International Travel and Health pages. Taiwan, whose population of 23 million is larger than 75 percent of those member countries, is excluded. This is "health apartheid" against Taiwan that should be addressed and rectified in no time.

China has put forth a number of arguments against Taiwan's entry, one of which is that Taiwan has no statehood at all, and the other is that there is no need for Taiwan's participation in the WHO because China looks after Taiwan's health interests. Nothing can be further from the truth. Taiwan is a 100 percent sovereign state, and China has never contributed in any way to the health needs of Taiwan. And contagious diseases don't recognize if you are a sovereign state or not.

In the year 2002, Taiwan registered 7.85 million outbound travelers and 2.19 million visitors. By the end of 2002, more than 300,000 migrant workers from five Southeast Asian countries were living and working in Taiwan. Taiwan is a bustling international trading center with $243 billion in foreign trade in 2002. The contact with China has been increasing. This combination of factors places Taiwan at the crossroads of any infectious disease outbreak in the region, like the current mysterious pneumonia; outbreaks have been reported in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, and unconfirmed new cases were reported in Vietnam and Taiwan.

Taiwan needs to have real-time information provided by the WHO to combat fatal disease and vice-versa.

In 2000, a survey in the British Economist Intelligence Unit rated medical practice in Taiwan as being second among all the developed countries and newly industrialized countries, next only to Sweden. From 1995 to 2002, Taiwan donated to the international community over $120 million in medical and humanitarian relief to 78 countries spanning five continents, plus $20 million to war-torn Afghanistan. Recently, Taiwan also donated $1 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In a nutshell, Taiwan should be an asset, not a liability, to the WHO. Why not accept it?

On August 17, 1999, a big earthquake devastated Turkey, yet Taiwan's experienced medical teams were not allowed to assist the rescue efforts. On September 21, 1999, a massive earthquake struck central Taiwan, killing 2,400 people and leaving more than 10,000 injured. China used its diplomatic muscle to obstruct foreign rescue assistance. Such inhumane practice would not have occurred were Taiwan a member of the WHO. The racial apartheid of the old days in South Africa is a disgrace in human history. The "health apartheid" against Taiwan is another shameful blow to the human race, one the international community has to take action to rectify now.

Inviting Taiwan to participate as an observer in sessions of the World Health Assembly (WHA) to be held this year from May 19 to 28 in Geneva is the first step. China should seize this opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to look after Taiwan's health interests. People in Taiwan have been shut out by a closed door long enough. It is high time for a change.

Fair balance Regarding "Eitan, Bar-On slam justice appointment process" by Gideon Alon, March 25:

In his article, Gideon Alon sheds much needed light on the Supreme Court in Israel, which wields tremendous power, yet does not represent both sides of the political spectrum. Here in the U.S., the federal and supreme courts are made up of judges who were nominated and appointed by presidents who were conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican, so there is a mixture of conservatives and liberals on the bench, who each reflect the majority of the population who elected those administrations. That is why we now have a conservative attorney general, John Ashcroft, who is deeply religious and very strong and aggressive in dealing with the threat of terrorism America now faces. It is undemocratic and shameful that the entire court system and Ministry of Justice in Israel is made up exclusively of secular, liberal judges and officials, who do not reflect the majority of the population who voted for a conservative government. Why are conservatives not represented in the Israeli court system, and civil and state administrations, for that matter, as they are in every other democratic country?

Orwellian double-speak Regarding "Smart bombs, obtuse commentators" by Gideon Levy, March 23:

I should just like to express my profound respect for the sentiments expressed by your correspondent Gideon Levy. If only others could match the degree of understanding and empathy shown by him, the world would be a much better and safer place. The sooner more people can think in this way, the sooner we will stop being harangued by the Orwellian double-speak of leaders like George Bush, spouting that we "Go to war in the name of peace," with innocent children suffering from the consequences of these words.

Never the right time

Abe Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, is quoted ("American Jews tread softly on `road map' during war in Iraq," March 26) as saying, "The timing is problematic" for the road map to lead to Palestinian-Israeli peace.

If Mr. Foxman is a man of genuine goodwill, then he should answer the question of whether he thinks there has ever been a non-problematic time for Palestinians to call for their freedom. Does he support a viable Palestinian state comprising the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem or not? If not, his words should carry little weight as the alternative to a viable Palestinian state - other than one state for both Palestinians and Israelis - is an apartheid-like bantustan. Surely the leader of the ADL would not call or implicitly back apartheid as an outcome for the Palestinians. And surely he will move speedily to denounce the inclusion of backers of ethnic cleansing in the current Sharon coalition government.

Too many civilians killed

Regarding the editorial "A contemptible comparison," March 27:

Your editorial makes the statement that "Israel, unlike Iraq, is not in violation of any Security Council decision," although "admittedly, the interpretation of some resolutions has been a matter of dispute."

Even if one ignores that Israel is usually protected by the veto power of the United States, this statement shows that the editor, who I assume is sincere, is in an extreme state of denial. Israel has repeatedly been condemned by the Security Council for its occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, occupation of parts of Lebanon, as well as for other acts of aggression such as bombing Tunisia in 1985, for which Israel surely has not yet paid the reparations mentioned in the resolution.

As a random example from the relatively recent past, consider resolution 1322 (2000) which, among other things, "[d]eplores the [...] violence [...] throughout the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, resulting in over 80 Palestinian deaths and many other casualties," and "[c]alls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949."

It must be a matter of "interpretation" whether the hundreds of civilians killed since by the Israel Defense Forces represent a violation of resolution 1322.

Jack Straw's comments

Sorry but I, and most of the non Jewish world, believe Straw has it right.

You know as well as I do that 50 years ago Jews were not allowed in American private universities or country clubs. Thank God, those days are over. But the policies of Israel in the last 30 years are such that there is now a wave of anti-Jewish feeling developing in the United States that even last week's Economist noticed. To return to the bad old days would not be in the interests of the Jewish people in the United States. Your government and its people should take steps to avoid such a disaster.

Can't really look in the mirror

The article claiming the comment by British Foreign Minister Jack Straw was contemptible because he compared the breaking of Security Council resolutions by Iraq and Israel is yet another example of us as Israelis not being able to look at ourselves in the eyes.

Isn't it time for us to acknowledge the truth about ourselves? As Israelis and as Jews, we have committed some heinous human rights abuses against the Palestinians. No, we haven't used chemical or biological weapons on them but we have kept them in administrative detention, humiliated them (not to mention the numerous cases of violent physical abuse by Border Police and soldiers), never given Palestinians any equality of rights when it came to pay or freedom of movement. They have had to line up on the streets like beggars to get work daily from Israeli contractors who took them for a ride.

The killing of innocent children, the use of live bullets crowd control, where the crowd is filled with children, the destruction of homes (not just for suspected "terrorist" connections, but for not having building permits) - have we not done enough for which to ask forgiveness? Do we always have to say, "No, others are worse than us"?

I know that what we do is wrong. It is shameful, and doesn't in any way make me feel proud of being a Jew or an Israeli. Can we not be responsible for our own actions?

Until we can learn to ask forgiveness from the Palestinians - and treat them with compassion - we are nothing but losers, and we will never, never get out of the war with them. Isn't it time to face the music?

ANC gets crucial 2/3 majority in S.Africa assembly
By Reuters	| Apr. 3, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has obtained a two-thirds majority in parliament - a crucial level of support needed to change the country's constitution.

The magic threshold was reached this week during the latest round of musical chairs by sitting members of parliament.

Under a controversial law that took effect last month, MPs can defect from one party to another during specific time-periods without seeking a new mandate from voters.

ANC chief whip Nkosinathi Nhleko said on Thursday the party had gained nine defectors via "floor-crossing," bringing its total seats to 275, or 68.75 percent of the 400-seat parliament.

The ANC had held 66 percent, or 266 seats, since the 1999 general elections - just under the threshold.

"The realignments signify the fact that South African society is reaching consensus about the correctness of ANC policies," Nhleko said in a statement.

But opposition parties criticized the way the ANC came by its seats, saying the matter should be decided democratically in elections. The next general elections will be held in 2004.

A two-thirds majority is required to change the constitution and its key bill of rights.

But any changes must also be in line with the bill of rights and must not contradict other parts of the constitution. If they do, they risk being struck down by the Constitutional Court, the highest court in South Africa, legal experts said.

The ANC has not signaled any plans to change the constitution, and Nhleko said despite the party's gains, it would strive to reach consensus on critical issues.

"It is an emotional thing. The ANC believes it has the backing of the overwhelming majority of the people and it was an anomaly that was not reflected in parliament," said Mogale Mashiapata of the Institute for Multiparty Democracy.

The ANC narrowly failed to reach the magic two-thirds limit in South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, which marked the end of apartheid and white minority rule, and again in 1999.

Critics have condemned floor-crossing as contempt for the electorate and portrayed the ANC as power hungry.

"Floor-crossing downgrades democracy. There is nothing democratic about a small elite class going against the wishes of the electorate and unilaterally changing parties," said Reverend Musa Zondi, spokesman of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).

The IFP is small nationally but controls the volatile and populous eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, the scene of sporadic violence pitting the IFP against the ANC in the last decade.

An unholy alliance with the Christian right
The annual conference of the powerful pro-Israel AIPAC lobby last week disproved the conspiracy theory that claimed the Jews persuaded President Bush to conquer Iraq. According to the same theory, the lobby is now pressing him not to present the road map to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the territories.

The annual conference of the powerful pro-Israel AIPAC lobby last week disproved the conspiracy theory that claimed the Jews persuaded President Bush to conquer Iraq. According to the same theory, the lobby is now pressing him not to present the road map to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the territories.

On the first day of the AIPAC convention, a man named Gary Bauer took the podium. He reminded the cheering thousands that God gave the Land of Israel to the Jewish people and, therefore, there is an absolute ban on giving it to another people. Bauer is not a member of the National Religious Party, nor of the Likud central committee. He's not even Jewish. He is a leading preacher from the Christian right in America, one of those who believe the Jews are The Chosen People and one day will even choose the right messiah. Bauer is a leading spokesman for arch-conservative policies, including a total ban on all abortions and favoring government funding for religious schools.

These are the people generating the spiritual energy fueling George Bush's war on global terrorism. Evangelist Christians from South Carolina paid for the huge billboard on the Ayalon Highway declaring "There's no land for peace." TV evangelist Pat Robertson last week reprimanded Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, saying "Who do you think you are, handing Jerusalem over to Arafat?"

With Christian friends like these close to the president's ear, the right-wing government in Israel does not need Jewish friends to rebuff political initiatives like the road map. But the Jewish activists are not giving up. The religious sources of the values that drive the Christian right are not preventing some Jewish organizations from turning them into a natural ally. Among those organizations are some that only a decade ago were thriving by exposing the anti-Semitic sloganeering in the sermons of some of their newfound friends.

This coming Passover, those Jews will devotedly recite "Next year in Jerusalem rebuilt," and a few might even do so from one of the hotels in the capital, which have been empty for the last two years. Those same activists joining the crusade against renewal of the political negotiations and against a settlement freeze know what a bloody price Israel is paying for the conflict in the territories. They are familiar with the ominous economic data threatening the social stability of their beloved country. They all understand that by the end of this decade, the Jews will become a minority between the Jordan and Mediterranean.

So what drives these Jewish professionals? A new poll for one of the Jewish organizations shows that their policy does not represent the Jewish street in America. According to this poll, 63 percent of American Jewry supports active involvement by the U.S. administration in the peace process. This could confirm the assessment of one senior Israeli diplomat, who noted that the name Jay Fielder, a young Jewish football player, is much better known to American Jews than that of Malcolm Hoenlein, the eternal executive vice-chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.

It is not because, as in Israel, the majority supports left-wing concessions but allows the political leadership to lead right-wing policies. The big difference between the two communities remains that Israeli Jews get blown up in buses, their sons have to guard settlers and their grandchildren can expect to grow up in a binational state or an apartheid regime. If it is difficult for those American Jewish busybodies to push the president and Congress into the cold water of the peace process, presumably one could expect they not try to force the administration to go in the opposite direction. They even have the right to draw fire to the Jews over the Iraq war, but they do not have the right to block even the slightest chance for peace here.


Days of Ubunto

It all began at Bergen-Belsen

The first two people I spoke with about national reconciliation in South Africa were murderers; the third is the current minister of education. "When did you first hear the term Ubuntu," I asked Ntobeko Penni, who answered that he'd heard his father use it when he was six years old. "Ubuntu" - humanness in Zulu - is an African outlook on life, the essence of which is that a person is a person through other people. Some say this perspective on life is largely what led to the foundation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), after apartheid's collapse in the latter half of the 1990s.

Penni, 28, was one of four young black men who murdered Amy Biehl, a young American woman who came to South Africa to show her solidarity with the black struggle. Penni and his comrades attacked her in the street and tore her to shreds.

Education Minister Kader Asmal said he only heard of Ubuntu in the past few years, after the term began to be used by the media as part of an attempt to root the TRC in the African tradition.

Asmal is a short, mustachioed man of 68, a Muslim of Indian descent, who looks and sounds like a British professor. No wonder - a graduate of the London School of Economics, he was not permitted to return to his homeland, and spent the next 25 years teaching law at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. Asmal was born in Natal province; his father was a shopkeeper. When Asmal was 11, he told me, he sneaked into a whites-only cinema. It was 1945. He doesn't remember what film was shown, but the newsreel that day changed his life. It was about the British Army's arrival at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He has never forgotten, and never will, the images of bulldozers clearing away piles of bodies, said Asmal. Afterward, he hurried to tell his mother that despite her wishes, he would not be an imam, but that he wanted to study law, so he could help those subjected to political persecution. And so he did. His legal and political activities led to his exile.

While living in Britain and Ireland, said Asmal, he spent a lot of time studying the history of Nazi Germany, the annihilation of the Jews and the Nuremberg trials. The more he learned, the more he expanded his political activity, and became one of the chief spokesmen in Europe against apartheid. One dream kept him going: Someday the evil regime in South Africa would collapse, and he would return home and devote himself to bringing to trial the criminals of the white regime; it would be an African Nuremberg trial.

In September 1990, Asmal was permitted to return. He accepted a university post as a professor of human rights, and began preparing for the trials he'd been envisioning for all those years. But Oliver Tambo, the legendary leader of the African National Congress (ANC), the leading underground group, decided there would be no trials in South Africa akin to those held for Nazi criminals, as such trials were vindictive, and were liable to tear up South Africa instead of uniting and building it. South Africa needed reconciliation, not revenge, he said. Other people involved in the establishment of the TRC confirm Asmal's story - up to here. Nor is there any argument that Tambo's and especially Nelson Mandela's wisdom and forethought, prevented Nuremberg-style "trials of revenge."

According to Asmal, Tambo asked him to think of another way to expose the truth about the crimes of the white regime. After some thought, Asmal suggested that instead of a trial, the government set up a public commission of inquiry. At first they wanted to call it the "Truth Commission," but in order to prevent any critics from dwelling on the Orwellian origins of the name, they settled on "Truth and Reconciliation Commission." The idea was implemented after much discussion, to which many voices contributed. One was attorney Albie Sachs, another champion of human rights.

Mama said

Sachs, of Jewish descent, is now 67. He was arrested during the apartheid era for his activities on behalf of the ANC. He was held in isolation and eventually forced out of his country. At first he settled in England, but later moved to Mozambique, where as a law professor he continued his anti-apartheid activities. The South African authorities must have felt that he had strong influence; they dispatched secret agents to Mozambique, who planted a bomb in his car. Sachs was miraculously saved, but the intensity of the blast caused him to lose his right arm and one eye. He, too, went home in 1990, and he now serves as a justice of the Constitutional Court.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Sachs told me, was not born so as to settle accounts with the white regime, but as the result of the need to deal with crimes of the ANC itself. The story begins with a session of the ANC's National Executive Committee in August 1993, held about eight months before the first-ever democratic elections in South Africa. It was a difficult meeting. The issue was how to deal with a report of an internal commission set up by the ANC to expose the barbaric interrogation methods used by its members against collaborators with the apartheid regime. Aside from the horrific tortures administered during interrogations, ANC men would detain suspected collaborators, place tires around their necks, and set them aflame. Sachs is proud that the ANC made the decision to investigate itself. It may be the only liberation movement to ever have done so, he says.

However, the feeling of self-satisfaction was not enough; the findings were atrocious, and something clearly had to be done. Discussion of the report continued for a long time. It was embarrassing, as the ANC was poised to assume control and lead South Africa into a new era. Finally, one of the participants stood up and asked simply, "Let us think for a moment what my mama would say about it." When he said `my mama' he meant the healthy logic of a simple, unsophisticated woman who may be unaware of politics but is blessed with a robust sense of decency and justice.

The speaker then offered the answer: "We are simply crazy. Here we are, examining our own weaknesses and faults, and exposing our nakedness to the whole world - which maybe has to be done - while in the meantime those rascals and villains on the other side, who for decades and centuries murdered, mutilated and tortured our people, are getting away scot-free." The others nodded their heads, and then Kader Asmal proposed a truth commission, which would expose all of the evil in its entirety, of all the evildoers, whites and non-whites alike.

Previously, there had been much discussion in South Africa about the possibility of setting up a forum for clarifying the historic truth. Committees had been formed, surveys held, experts from other countries consulted. There was a study of how other countries, such as Argentina, Chile and Zimbabwe, had handled the issue.

The upheaval

The apartheid regime evolved over the years and did not collapse all at once. It gradually crumbled, primarily, it seems, as a result of the international sanctions enacted against South Africa. The breakup of the Soviet Union nullified the main factor that justified the apartheid regime, besides the racist ideology itself. Many whites truly believed that the evil regime was necessary to protect their country from the Communist threat. In retrospect, everyone now speaks of ideological laxity, fatigue, a general feeling of "we can't go on this way" among the whites. The governing party had become a doormat, the economic situation deteriorated. There was a feeling that everything was falling apart, and masses of people were leaving the country.

In the 1980's, the authorities began to cancel some regulations of "the petty apartheid," which forbade blacks from sitting in public parks on white-only benches, or using telephone booths or public restrooms designated for use by whites. However, the fundamentals of discrimination, including the lack of a parliamentary vote for blacks, were supposed to remain unchanged. But the willingness to nibble at the foundations of apartheid seems to have done to South Africa what perestroika did to the Soviet Union. The authorities were unable to control the narrow cracks that opened in the wall of repression, the cracks grew wider and the walls fell. The journalist and commentator Vessel de Kock explained to me that as more black workers were being allowed to live in close proximity to white-owned factories, over time a mixed economy developed: The political system was no longer suited to the economic situation and therefore had to be changed. Meanwhile, the ANC was growing stronger.

Colin Eglin, a veteran parliamentarian, told me that Frederik Willem de Klerk, the last white president, decided to hold talks with the blacks shortly before he lost everything. Nelson Mandela accepted the offer shortly before he was to win everything. The result was a uniquely realistic compromise. Many whites in South Africa, if not all, and numerous foreign observers, assumed that with the collapse of apartheid, the blacks would rise up, drive out the whites, and slaughter any that stayed behind, to avenge centuries of racism, during which the evil was, at its height, equivalent to that of the Nazis. That this did not happen is referred to by some as "the miracle of South Africa."

I spent some time asking people to explain this "miracle" to me, but I eventually stopped. The question itself shows a prejudice, journalist Zubeida Jaffer told me. We aren't a primitive tribe of man-eaters. She suggested I read the ANC publications dating back to its inception in the early 20th century, and especially the freedom charter it adopted in the early `50s. The movement had never threatened to kill the whites. On the contrary, it had always called for reestablishing life on the basis of full equality, calling for South Africa to be a state of all its citizens, blacks and whites and all the others too.

Jaffer is a well-known political commentator. We sailed to Robben Island, where Mandela was held prisoner for 18 of the 27 years of his incarceration. On the way there, she spoke of her own arrest and torture. As a talented reporter with good sources, she was able to report exclusive news about the black struggle. The authorities suspected her of belonging to an underground organization, and had her arrested. The interrogators threatened to rape her - but did not do so, although they did beat her, and forced her to swallow a drug that caused nausea, and pain all over her body. At the time of her second arrest, she was pregnant. The interrogators threatened to "burn her fetus," but she was released before her daughter's birth. Only recently has she begun to recover. Prior to her arrest, Jaffer was allowed to visit prisoners held on Robben Island together with Mandela. The current visit to the prison as a tourist, with me, provoked strange feelings.

Island of Good Hope

Robben Island has served as a place of detention almost from the day Vasco de Gama dropped anchor there 500 years ago, as a quarantine camp for slaves and lepers, and a prison for criminal convicts and political opponents. Some of the men imprisoned together with Mandela now serve as guides, sharing their memories with the tourists. At the height of the tour, the visitor arrives at Mandela's cell.

Conditions were harsh, and the wardens abusive. Mandela and his comrades spent part of the time working in a nearby quarry; the dazzling light severely damaged his eyesight. The long years on Robben Island had an effect on his worldview: the prolonged struggle for improving prison conditions made him more acutely realistic, taught him to better assess what can and cannot be achieved, judge when to be stubborn and when to yield.

The more the whites withdrew from their positions, the more the security forces demanded that any settlement be conditioned upon a blanket amnesty for anyone involved in the crimes of apartheid, including expulsions, liquidations, faked terrorist attacks, torture, murder, rape, plunder and corruption. At one stage, the talks nearly broke down over this demand. Several army leaders threatened to start a civil war. On this point, the nation's jurists, including Justice Minister Dullah Omar, seem to have played a significant role. Albie Sachs' wisdom and prestige also aided in resolving this disagreement.

A blanket amnesty was out of the question, of course, Sachs explained to me. But the controversy threatened the acceptance of the new constitution, which may be the best and most righteous constitution in the world. Its acceptance saved South Africa from a civil war and perhaps from complete destruction. Sachs feels the constitution was worth conceding on the sensitive issue of granting amnesty to apartheid criminals. After much effort, the sides reached a compromise: no blanket amnesty - instead, separate discussion of each and every case as part of the TRC hearings. Along with granting amnesty, the commission was also authorized to rule on compensation to victims of the regime.

Amnesty seekers had to comply with two main conditions: First, they had to disclose the truth about their crimes, although they were not required to express remorse. Second, they had to prove that their acts were performed as part of their political position. This was new: Most people accused of crimes against humanity defend themselves by arguing that "they were only carrying out orders." This line of defense has not been accepted, partially because of the duty of refusing a blatantly illegal order. In South Africa, they took the opposite course: Anyone who could prove he committed the acts while serving the country, or even while serving its political ideology, qualified for amnesty. Many of those harmed by apartheid, especially the families of its victims, had a hard time accepting the idea of criminals going unpunished. Sachs is not happy with the amnesty arrangement, either, even though he had much influence on its acceptance.

Sachs told me about the day that a man named Henry appeared in his chambers. A former South African army officer, he told Sachs that he had been involved in gathering the intelligence prior to the booby-trapping of Sachs' car. Sachs tried to draw him out: He was an excellent officer who evidently believed he was dispatching a dangerous enemy. They sat together for nearly two hours. "He looked at me almost with a measure of jealousy. I was a judge of the Constitutional Court, and he had been cast aside and was unemployed. He too had injuries, he told me. He had been shot in the leg and walked with a slight limp. We could have gone on eyeing each other and talking forever. I stood up and said: `Henry, (a cheap emotion surged in me. I was tempted to say: `I cannot shake your hand. You know why.') I cannot shake your hand now. Go to the TRC, tell them your story, do something for South Africa and then maybe we'll meet again.' He looked so uncomfortable, uneasy and sad when he left."

Henry is one of thousands of witnesses who have appeared before the commission and requested amnesty. The two men eventually did see each other again, at which time Sachs shook the other's hand. Sachs did not ask if Henry had received amnesty. He thinks he did. The number of amnesty recipients is relatively low: about 2,000 of the 7,000 who applied for it. The granting of amnesty has not added much luster to the commission's prestige, and in retrospect, along with its successes it has had its weaknesses. Mary Burton, a member of the commission, told me about them.

We are all guilty

She was born in Argentina and came to South Africa with her husband, whom she met while studying in Europe. It was the early 1960's. Her husband and his family opposed apartheid and voted for the progressive opposition, but like many other whites, they thanked God that their party was not winning the elections, says Burton. She is not cynical by nature, but the years have taught her to delve behind the slogans and cliches; an impressive woman. She volunteered for a charity organization operating in the black townships. The more she struck roots in her new country, the more questions she had. At one stage, she found herself among the women of the "Black Sash," a sort of South African version of Women in Black. The two organizations are in contact with one another. It was legal, extra-parliamentary activity. She was arrested only once, briefly. The Black Sash women opposed the granting of amnesty to apartheid criminals.

This, in fact, caused Burton to rethink acceptance of her appointment to the 17-member commission, who were selected by President Nelson Mandela from a list of candidates who were approved after a hearing that was broadcast on television. None were politicians; most were former anti-apartheid activists. It is not the sort of appointment that is easily turned down, and Mary Burton eventually overcame her hesitancy.

It was a difficult experience. Members of the commission were divided into three sub-committees: one heard evidence of gross human rights violations from 1960 onward; a second handled amnesty requests, and a third dealt with applications for aid to victims and their families, including financial aid and compensation. The hearings went on for two years; the commission heard thousands of witnesses who were first classified by a staff of investigators. A sum of $20 million was allocated to the commission. The testimony they heard was harrowing and heartrending.

At one point or another, every member of the commission reached his or her breaking point, Mary Burton said. She reached hers when hearing a rather ordinary story: A boy of 15 had gone to a grocery store, walked into the crossfire at a demonstration, and was killed. His mother told the story to the commission, while the father sat and looked on. One commission member asked him what he would say to his son's murderers if he met them. Burton feels the question was improper, but the result was almost too hard to bear. Because the father suddenly stood up and gave vent to a colossal outburst of pain and hatred and mainly of helplessness. She does not know why this story is the one that broke her.

The commission was headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. He designed its hearings to be a purifying and corrective religious experience. His deputy was Dr. Alex Boraine, a Methodist minister and former MP who now teaches law in New York. Mary Burton said she and several other commission members had some serious arguments with Tutu. They objected to the religious dimension he placed on the hearings. They asked him not to appear at commission hearings wearing his priestly vestments, or to open sessions with a daily prayer. But Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, stood his ground. It may have been more than a mere matter of style: The entire character of the proceedings, and especially the idea of amnesty being issued by the commission in exchange for revelation of the truth, was deeply rooted in Christian theology.

Often there was something superficial about the proceedings: All it took was for an individual to confess the truth and he was assured of forgiveness. It is doubtful whether this could have worked as simply between Jews and Muslims. In fact, the conflict in South Africa was resolvable because, unlike the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it contained no elements of religious rivalry. Most residents of South Africa are Christians, and Tutu used Christianity as a source of inspiration for reconciliation.

Another source of inspiration was the doctrine of Ubuntu. There are still arguments over what had a greater effect on the character of the hearings - Christianity, Ubuntu or politics. The hearings about crimes committed by the black organizations, including those of blacks against blacks, created a "we are all guilty" atmosphere. When everyone is guilty, no one is really guilty, and some critics felt that Tutu seemed to be wrapping his purple robes around everyone. He, on the other hand, saw it as a requisite basis for national reconciliation.

Tutu often sobbed as he listened to the harrowing stories. From time to time he would also call for dramatic gestures of reconciliation. One of the heights of this came as Winnie Mandela completed her testimony. She had been called in to clarify certain facts about the death of a boy named Stompie. He was murdered at her home, evidently with her active and sadistic participation. After her testimony, Tutu suddenly called on the boy's mother to come to the front of the hall, and asked her to embrace Winnie Mandela. He had given her no prior warning. The mother, a simple woman, did as she was asked. It was a big show of reconciliation. Mary Burton was not fond of these scenes. She could barely believe her ears when I told her about my meeting with the murderers of Amy Biehl.

Amy Biehl was here

Hanging in the entry to the central Cape Town offices of the Amy Biehl Foundation is a large photograph in which she is smiling happily, a black child in her arms. Amy, her parents told me, was raised on anti-apartheid; even as a child in California she would wear hats adorned with the slogan "Free Nelson Mandela." It was therefore quite natural for her to visit South Africa as an adult. A graduate of Stanford University, she arrived as a Fulbright scholar and took on all sorts of communal projects. Working with the blacks in South Africa was a reflection of her world view: she believed in the equality of human beings and in multi-racial democracy.

Her four black killers attacked her with stones and knives - they shattered her skull and mutilated her body practically beyond recognition. Peter and Linda Biehl - rather wealthy people, not especially religious - decided to continue her life's work. The foundation they established underwrites education, health and professional training projects, as well as artistic and musical activities - all among blacks, all in the spirit of Amy.

Her four murderers were arrested, tried and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Linda Biehl was present at several court sessions. She says she felt nothing as she sat across from her daughter's murderers. Albie Sachs told her it would be good if she could make some sort of contact with the father of one of the murderers, who was also sitting in the court. At one stage, their eyes met, and at that moment she felt a sadness: He too was about to lose a son, she thought. They shook hands.

The murderers later applied to the TRC and asked that the lynch be recognized as a political act. This was the first step on the road to amnesty. They explained that before committing the murder, they had attended a gathering of a radical black group. The speaker had instructed his listeners to kill any white who happened to cross their path. Amy Biehl happened to be the one. When Peter and Linda Biehl heard of the amnesty request, they called Tutu from their home in California and said they had no objections to granting the amnesty, but that they wanted to be at the hearing. "We wanted South Africa to know that we respect the reconciliation efforts it is making, and we wanted an opportunity to tell South Africa and the entire world about our Amy," Linda Biehl explained to me.

Arriving at the hall, they found themselves in a narrow corridor. Suddenly the four murderers appeared before them. Without thinking too much, the Biehls held out their hands. Linda Biehl said that once again she felt nothing. The commission complied with the request of the four men, who were given political amnesty, and released. I asked the Biehls what they thought about the murderers. Linda Biehl says that two of them are detestable thugs, but that the other two were sort of "political soldiers." What they did was a result of the brainwashing done to them, and they had in the meantime realized their error. I asked how she knew that, at which point the conversation took a shocking turn. "Actually, they're really nice guys," says Linda Biehl. "They have nice girlfriends, and tomorrow we're taking all of them out to see the musical `Cats.'"

It was hard to hide my stupefaction. Linda Biehl said they hadn't yet seen the musical, and it was now playing in Cape Town. I asked if we were really talking about two of her daughter's murderers and their girlfriends. Had I really understood her right? She and her husband were taking them out? Linda Biehl chuckled, and said that a lot of people are amazed when they hear that she and her husband employ the two murderers in their foundation. For a second, I thought she was pulling my leg, but Linda Biehl chuckled again and said, "Oh, I thought you knew. Didn't you notice the fellow sitting by the front door next to the computer? That's Ntobeko."

While I was still wondering what to say, Mrs. Biehl called the two fellows over to join us. The other one's name is Easy Nofemela. For the next 45 minutes we sat together - Amy Biehl's two murderers, her two parents and me.

Ntobeko Penni is 28, Nofemela is 30. Both now work at the foundation. "They didn't have any work when they got out of prison, and we needed people," explained Peter Biehl. Penni actually wanted to be a social worker or journalist, but has a good head for business. The foundation is supposedly helping him to start a driving school; that is his dream. Nofemela will receive a bakery, if I understood Peter Biehl correctly. "We thought that would fulfill the reconciliation. This is the meaning of Ubuntu," says Biehl.

I told the two killers that I could not understand Amy's parents, and asked them to explain to me the meaning of the Biehl's attitude toward them. Ntobeko Penni said that he didn't really understand it, either, but that he is grateful to them. He calls Linda Biehl "Makulu" - grandmother in Zulu. Linda Biehl said it was so, and that it makes her happy, because her new grandson Alexander, born in America, also calls her Makulu. Ntobeko said that it was definitely harder for me to understand the relationship since I evidently don't understand what Ubuntu is.

Anthropologists have studied the term, and explained the concept of reconciliation that derives from it. If I correctly understand what I read, when a person harms his fellow man, he also harms the perfection of his own humanity, and thereby also harms the perfection of his victim's humanity. When the victim forgives him, he restores the humanity of the attacker, and in so doing also restores his own humanity. Ntobeko Penni explained that Ubuntu also has meaning in everyday life, the essence of which is mutual aid. If someone has nothing to eat, someone will share his bread with him. If someone has nowhere to sleep, someone will offer him a place in his home.

There are local reconciliation committees on every street, operating as quasi magistrate's courts: If two people are fighting, the neighborhood reconciliation committee sees to it that they settle the argument. Penni said that Ubuntu, which he learned in his childhood from his father, also requires one to show respect and dignity to every person, in other words, a sort of African humanism.

I said that it indeed sounded very noble and asked him, then, why he murdered Amy. "Ahhh," Ntobeko Penni said, "The rules of Ubuntu don't apply to whites." "No, no," said Linda Biehl, "Ubuntu doesn't apply to whites."

Where are the graves?

Mary Burton believes that much of the truth will come out and that this is certainly important, because, like Archbishop Tutu, she believes there can be no healing without truth. But a significant share of the truth is not being revealed. Burton is referring mainly to the acts committed by heads of the military and political establishments. Many of them just don't give a damn about the commission. The law empowered the commission to subpoena and interrogate witnesses, but too many people avoided the hearings, lied to the commission or simply ignored it. The commission missed many opportunities, says Burton. She blames herself, too. She and the other commission members weren't strong enough.

Cape Town District Court Judge Dennis Davis took me one morning on a climb to the peak of Lions Head, to gaze at the ocean. The view from the mountain top is breathtaking: Cape Town is rightly considered one of the most beautiful cities in the world. As we were climbing, the judge explained that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's work had convinced him that the criminal law process was better suited to uncovering the truth. The fact is, Davis said, that the chance of getting an amnesty had not convinced the generals and leading statesmen to appear before the committee.

Constitutional Court Justice Albie Sachs disagrees. He unwillingly admits to the limitations of the judicial system, but in his estimate, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission exposed much more information than might have been exposed by the ordinary wheels of justice. No, Sachs confirmed, not all of the criminals had paid their debt, but the commission had achieved a great deal, including the revelation of what befell many of the people who had disappeared, and where they were buried. The commission could not bring the dead back to life, but at least it gave graves to their relatives.

Essentially, it gave them something even more important: an opportunity to tell their story. In that respect, the commission hearings are a little like the Eichmann trial. It too was designed as a sort of national spectacle, the sentence known in advance. But the trial enabled Holocaust survivors to tell a story that until then Israel was not ready to hear, and in those terms it opened up a process of national therapy. The same sort of thing happened in South Africa. That process is still in its infancy.

The Eichmann trial gave birth to an important theory about the nature of the murderer and the "banality of evil." The TRC hearings only partially confirmed this thesis. Many apartheid criminals did what they did out of a firm belief in their cause, after undergoing a gradual process of hardening. Like the Nazis, they did not see the blacks as human beings like themselves, and the more they humiliated and abused them - the more the humanity of their victims was reduced, and the ideology seemed to fulfill itself.

Transcripts of the commission's proceedings can provide an important basis for investigation of the subject, but Mary Burton says the commission did not take the required steps to ensure that its work would be properly archived and available for research purposes. She therefore fears that the hearings will in time be forgotten. But the biggest blunder has to do with compensation, she feels. That is also of greatest concern to Anglican priest Michael Lapsley.

Where is the money?

Lapsley came to South Africa from New Zealand. He did not arrive with political opinions, but influenced by the situation, he joined the ANC. Members of the group ascertained that his life was in danger, and sent him to Zimbabwe. One day he arrived home from a lecture tour in Canada and began opening the letters that had piled up in his absence. Lapsley pulled off the plastic wrapper of an envelope of theology journals, detonating the explosives inside. He remembers flying into the air; he remained fully conscious the entire time. Lapsley lost both hands and one eye. He is now the director of the Institute for Healing of Memories, a sort of workshop that helps victims of the former regime to cope with their traumas. Lapsley offers this caveat: All of the achievements of the TRC could come to naught if the government does not compensate victims of the old regime.

This was one of the commission's main recommendations. About 20,000 persons harmed by the regime are supposed to receive $2,000 each, in six annual payments, totaling approximately $40 million. But the government has not yet paid, and many victims of apartheid feel betrayed. This does not encourage a mood of reconciliation.

And it's not the only thing: South Africa is rife with unemployment, crime and Aids. About 250,000 people are dying of the plague every year; most are black. I asked Minister Kader Asmal about the compensation, and he offered, in a bureaucratic tone of voice, that the commission must first submit its final report, meaning that it must still compose two more volumes of mainly technical material. It is amazing how quickly underground fighters can adopt the excuses of government.

Kader's friends

Asmal invited me to a family celebration. He and his English wife Louise were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. For the occasion, they had rented the restaurant in the world-famous Kirstenbosch botanical gardens. A special menu had been printed on gold paper: The appetizers were Mediterranean style, the main course was a chicken curry. The guests, most of whom were Indian or black, came in formal wear. Many drove up in Mercedes sedans. Men with clear plastic buttons in their ears walked about in the parking lot and entrance; before being allowed into the restaurant, the guests were asked to pass through metal detectors. And Nelson Mandela was there, too.

Mandela, 85 and white-haired, radiates nobility and charisma; his presence at the celebration will presumably be considered one of the high points of the minister's career. Half a dozen ministers attended Asmal's celebration, and guests came from abroad as well, anti-apartheid activists from England and Holland. Mandela sat at the head table. Some of the guests dared to approach him; a few were honored with an invitation to sit down with him for a minute or two. He wore an African shirt, and put on an informal mood. But the whole gathering seemed like a party-event. Asmal had met his wife while working for the ANC; everything they'd been through together was related to the national struggle. Their life was the struggle, the struggle was their life.

Once Mandela left, the men loosened their ties, the minister's grandchildren recited humorous rhymes to Grandpa Kader and Grandma Louise, and there was also dancing, to music that was a blend of Western and African beats. I had the impression I was with a new elite celebrating its victory with comfort, not yet with arrogance. This, I imagined, is how Mapai insiders celebrated in the 1950s. And if they were close enough - David Ben-Gurion might even grace their parties. The future was theirs. At Tony Leon's party, on the other hand, a dejected atmosphere prevailed. The guests were bogged down in the past.

Tony's friends

Tony Leon, leader of the opposition, heads a small party that is not unlike Shinui and Meretz. It isn't easy being the opposition to a national unity government; the ANC shares rule with the National Party, which was the party of apartheid. The National Alliance, which Leon heads, recently lost a few parliament deputies, who went over to the government's side.

He is an impressive man who exudes great personal charm. Leon lives in a nice home with an Israeli wife, Michal (nee Even-Zahav), and their two children. Leon, his wife and two children attempted to set a relaxed atmosphere, but the folks gathered round the family swimming pool were in no mood to celebrate. They know, of course, that the white time is passing. I spoke at length with Colin Eglin, a MP who with Helen Suzman and others cried for many years the cry of their beloved country, of liberals and patriots against the injustice of apartheid. I believe I learned a lot from him, there alongside the Leon family pool. The zeal with which the old regime oppressed its enemies infused their struggle with hope. Eglin spoke of those days almost nostalgically.

We spoke about the rewriting of history. Everyone now uses history for political purposes. After the flag and the anthem, they start changing names of entire cities, to adapt them to the whims of the current regime. There is a new museum in Johannesburg that documents the apartheid, which visitors are required to enter in two separate lines, one for whites, one for blacks. A guide beckoned me over to a wall that commemorates over 160 underground fighters sentenced to death during apartheid. One case provides an especially detailed description. It is no coincidence that this one was selected - the judge who handed down the death sentence was Ramon Leon, whom the guide emphatically explains is the father of Tony Leon.

Regrettably, it would be hard to say that the old regime collapsed as the result of activities of the liberal opposition. Many whites now claim that they had always, either openly or not, opposed apartheid. This is also the dominant trend in the new Jewish museum in Cape Town. In a somewhat pathetic attempt to adapt history to the new situation, the museum emphasizes the part played by Jews in opposing discrimination against blacks, as if they represented the entire community. The truth is that some Jews stood out for their role in the struggle against apartheid, but most of them made their peace with the old regime and benefited from the privileges they were granted as whites. The museum does not conceal the fact, but minimizes it as much as possible.

It reminded me of a line in Nadine Gordimer's "July's People": "The present was his; he would arrange the past to suit it." Nadine Gordimer attended several sessions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. She can identify with those willing to forgive and reconcile, she told me, but she can also understand those who refuse to reconcile, and demand vengeance. She mostly identified with victims of the regime who refuse to forgive, but do not seek revenge. She thinks this is how she would react if she were in their shoes. She would want not want to have anything to do with the hearings, she said.

S. African court sentences Winnie Mandela to jail for fraud
By Reuters	| Apr. 25, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
PRETORIA - A South African court sentenced Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to jail for fraud on Friday, but the anti-apartheid heroine emerged defiant from court, punching a fist into the air as supporters shouted "Viva".

The flamboyant former wife of Nelson Mandela, convicted on Thursday of dozens of counts of fraud and theft in a bogus bank loan scandal, maintained her innocence and has appealed.

Saying he saw "not one hint" of remorse, Pretoria Magistrate Peet Johnson sentenced Madikizela-Mandela, 66, to five years in jail with one year suspended. However, he cited a legal provision that would let a parole board cut the term to as little as eight months.

Madikizela-Mandela immediately resigned from parliament and posts in the ruling African National Congress (ANC), signalling the likely end of a maverick political career of a woman dubbed "the Mother of the Nation" for her fight against apartheid during her former husband's 27-year imprisonment.

Madikizela-Mandela and her co-accused, broker Addy Moolman, were found guilty of stealing one million rand ($136,986) in the elaborate fraud scheme. Moolman, who also appealed, was sentenced to seven years in prison, with two years suspended.

State prosecutors said letters bearing Madikizela-Mandela's signature were used to secure loans for bogus employees of the Women's League of the ANC, which she heads.

Madikizela-Mandela's lawyers accused Moolman, bank staff and Women's League employees of lying about her role. They said she was duped into participating in a fraud she knew nothing about.

Johnson said Madikizela-Mandela was no "modern-day Robin Hood" and said she appeared to have arranged the fraud to help friends and associates. He said he recognised her role in the anti-apartheid struggle but that was not enough to get her off.

"The message has to be sent out that this type of behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated, no matter who the transgressor," the magistrate said.

Both defendants, both released on bail pending appeal, were also found guilty of theft charges stemming from charges they set up a phoney funeral insurance scheme and then pilfered money from participants' accounts.

Dressed in a beaded headband, white flowered kaftan and traditional bead necklace, Madikizela-Mandela showed no reaction as the sentence was passed.

Two supporters briefly interrupted court proceedings to shout support for Madikizela-Mandela, who is known as "Mama" to many of the poor township youths she has taken under her wing.

"You are the ANC, Mama!" one activist yelled in the stunned courtroom, before being hustled out.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the court, many chanting anti-apartheid slogans in support of their heroine. Ranks of police, some in riot helmets, blocked off the court entrance.

Madikizela-Mandela briefly appeared on the courthouse steps after the sentence, raising her fist in a defiant salute to cheers before bodyguards hustled her back in the building.

At a separate court hearing in Cape Town's High Court, Madikizela-Mandela's legal bid to stop parliament's ethics committee publicly reprimanding her for failing to declare income was dismissed and she was ordered to pay costs.

In a statement, Madikizela-Mandela said she would resign from parliament as well as from her ANC posts.

"The ANC is my home. Its ideals are my passion and its endeavours to make South Africa a just society is a cause that I will not relinquish. I will remain a dedicated, committed and loyal member of the ANC," she said, adding that she was sure her innocence would eventually be proved.

The move appeared to end her political career, although she has defied critics who wrote her off in the past.

Despite her widespread popularity, Madikizela-Mandela's reputation has been tarnished by a series of legal problems. She was detained and put under house arrest by the apartheid administration but has never served a jail term.

The most serious past conviction was in 1991, for kidnapping and being an accessory to assault in connection with the death of a 14-year-old township activist. Her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine on appeal.

Problematic policies
A comprehensive, if somewhat uneven, collection of articles offers a historical perspective of the Israeli Foreign Ministry's first 50 years
By Gabriel Sheffer	May 2, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
"Ministry for Foreign Affairs: The First Fifty Years," edited by Moshe Yegar, Yosef Govrin and Arie Oded, The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, printed by Keter Press, 1,211 pages, NIS 168

The extensive media discussion surrounding the appointment of the foreign minister in "the second Sharon government" once again underlined a certain paradox with respect to the Foreign Ministry. On the one hand, the ministry's scope of activity, the actions and moves taken within the ministry's realm of responsibility, and the various appointments there earn more coverage than the realms of responsibility and activity at other ministries (the Prime Minister's Office and the Israel Defense Forces, of course, excepted). Thus, it is difficult to compare the quantity of reports on the foreign minister and foreign policy to those published, for example, on the education and welfare ministries. However, despite this exposure, despite the ostensible prestige of the foreign service and despite the generally high quality of the personnel who serve in the ministry, its status in the government system and its influence on the determination of policy are quite marginal. And to put it mildly, the minor status and influence of the ministry, which are forced upon it by the prime minister and the Defense Ministry, are far from satisfactory, according to its senior personnel, ambassadors and various state representatives.

Now, added to the many publications, including collections of documents, memoirs by ministers, ambassadors and other envoys, and books written by academics and journalists, is this huge collection before us. This volume contains more than 1,000 pages and is comprised of no less than 129 articles and essays written by 85 Foreign Ministry employees. The management of the Foreign Ministry initiated and funded the publication of the volume to mark the 50th anniversary of Israel and the ministry, but apparently it left the decisions concerning the publication in the hands of the three editors, who in the past were ambassadors and filled senior positions at the ministry and have written a great deal about these matters.

Because of the extent of the volume, the many subjects with which the articles deal, the numerous kinds of articles and their varying quality, the editors of such a volume are not to be envied, nor is the reviewer or critic of this book, including the writer of these lines, who must evaluate such an extensive and varied "product." Therefore, this will not be a focused examination of the contents of the various articles and their quality, but rather a general evaluation of a number of basic issues that have to do with the status of the Foreign Ministry, the value of the book and its contribution to the understanding of this important subject.

`Revisionist' approach

In this spirit, first a few basic comments with respect to the status of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which the volume is intended to reflect. As Moshe Yegar notes in his important article ("The Foreign Ministry: Structure, Work Methods and Conclusions"), in the early years following the establishment of the State of Israel, the ministry's status was not inferior relative to the Prime Minister's Office, the Defense Ministry and the IDF. Despite David Ben-Gurion's totalitarian image and the commonly held perception that he was in absolute control, ostensibly, of all policy issues - thanks to the political standing and interest of the founder of the ministry, the first foreign minister and second prime minister, Moshe Sharett, until the latter's resignation from the government of Israel in 1956 - he himself and the Foreign Ministry participated to a very great extent in setting policy in the area of foreign affairs and defense, as well as in tangential matters that touched upon many crucial issues. Therefore, in this area and other areas in which Israeli policy was established during that period, there has to be a serious historical and analytical revision by the "new historians" and a true liberation from fixed notions in Israel's short history. The volume under review here can help considerably in this revision.

And indeed, as Yegar rightly notes, Sharett's insistence on ensuring the senior and autonomous status of the Foreign Ministry in matters of defense, political and economic policy, and the relations with Diaspora Jewry, did not derive only from concern for his own status and the status of his ministry, but rather from a firm belief that policy considerations must be manifested primarily in the policies of the nation and the state. Sharett believed that the extra weight of the security-military dimension, coalition politics and considerations of personal relationships caused much damage to Israel. In retrospect, it turns out that his position was correct. Its non-adoption led - and is still leading - to serious damage to Israel.

Yegar, who notes that he himself did not see eye to eye with Sharett on ideological and policy issues, is also right on target when he writes that in the days of Sharett's successors, the status of the Foreign Ministry changed for the worse - especially when the Prime Minister's Office, the Defense Ministry and the IDF became the factors that were most instrumental in influencing Israeli policy at home and abroad.

Yegar adds rightly that only the future will tell whether, when peace prevails in the region, the status of the Foreign Ministry will grow stronger in relation to the total supremacy until now of the defense and military people. He sums up with the following apt words: "An intelligent combination of security, foreign policy and diplomatic efforts, while considerations of prestige are ignored, is no simple matter, but the way this is carried is the test of the nation's leadership." These words should be internalized by Israel's senior politicians, on both the right and the left.

Not a `victory album'

As noted, this volume is comprised of articles and essays by many Foreign Ministry employees who have dealt with various aspects of the ministry's activity during the first 50 years of its existence. Using an approach that recognizes the necessity for appropriate openness, and with a clear-eyed perspective of the problematic status and achievements of the Foreign Ministry regarding key issues of national policy, the editors note in their "Editorial Comment" that the collection is not a "victory album." But they are incorrect when they say that it is not a memorial book along the lines of "Friends tell about ...": Many (too many) of the articles include memoirs of the activities of ministry personnel in the 16 areas according to which the articles are arranged - a division that reflects the structure of the divisions and departments at the ministry. Such articles do not stress the analytical dimension, which is what in the main lends significance to and bestows importance on a publication of this sort.

At the same time, despite the cautious approach of the diplomats who have contributed to the volume, with a minimal effort it is possible to discern the political leanings of several of them and to learn from this that for the most part, the people who work in the foreign service are prepared to serve equally political bosses who have divergent political and ideological views and are not cut of a single political cloth. In fact, they bring to their work at the Foreign Ministry a variety of political opinions and they are able to express criticism, even if it is only implied, of the policy-makers and of the policy itself.

One of these implied criticisms by the professional diplomats who have contributed to this collection touches upon the very heart of Israeli foreign policy - and, in fact, the very heart of Israeli policy in other areas. The criticism lies in the fact that the writers of many of the articles in this volume focus primarily on the policy and actions of the states and the various organizations with which Israel has cooperated, or with which it has been in conflict (for example, the article by Eliezer Palmor "Israel, the Soviet Union and the States of Eastern Europe: Remarks in Summation of 50 years of a Unique Relationship," and other articles), and mainly focus on the Israeli reaction to the moves undertaken by these states and organizations.

And, indeed, as in other areas, except for, primarily, the military area and the area of Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel, Israel's policy has been, and continues to be, a problematic reactive policy. Only in very few of the cases mentioned in this book did Israel show initiative. Two areas in which the country did take the initiative, however, are surveyed in the article by Reuven Merhav on relations between Israel and China ("The Dream of Red Sanctuaries ..."), and in the article by David Ariel on relations between Israel and South Africa ("Impressions of Israeli-South African Relations at the Crumbling of Apartheid").

Perhaps because of the ministry's marginality and perhaps because of the nature of diplomacy in general and of Israeli diplomacy and diplomats in particular, too few of the articles are frankly critical of the bullying Israeli outlook on international relations - which is significantly influenced by the "realistic" approach that is now very controversial internationally - and of Israeli aims and the strategies and tactics Israel adopted during the first 50 years (the beginning of Ze'ev Sufot's article on "Israel's Chinese Policy" excels in detailing of this sort, and in the volume there are several more articles of this kind).

Measure of caution

Additional limitations of the volume derive from the fact that many of the articles it contains have been published previously and are familiar to people in this field. Therefore, taking into consideration the large measure of caution that is characteristic of professional diplomats, the degree of innovation concerning the various aspects is meager. In addition to the cautiousness of expression, the problematic emphasis in the articles that are based mainly on writers' memoirs, and the tendency to avoid analysis, this volume places a great deal of stress on legal issues. Moreover, as the editors themselves testify: "Not all the articles that were contributed to this volume are equal in quality and importance," and this is because "various considerations have guided us [the editors] in determining the inclusion of material."

Even if the editors did not go into detail, it is not difficult to imagine some of those considerations by editors who are trying or who have been asked to publish articles by friends or acquaintances who worked together with them for many years.

Nevertheless, this is a very important volume, primarily for researchers, journalists, students and teachers. But it is also important for anyone who is interested in the history of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and Israeli foreign policy. Even if not all regions, countries, issues and episodes are discussed in it, this is a very rich source of information on Israeli policy during certain periods, and on various states and regions of the world.

In this context, special attention must be given to some of the articles in Section II, which deals with the Middle East, and especially to the articles on the peace talks and arms supervision in the region; to some of the articles in Section IX, which deals with the United Nations; in Section X, which deals with the Jewish Diaspora; in Section XI, which deals with economic diplomacy; in Section XIII, which discusses Israel and the Christian world; and in particular in Section XV, which discusses Israeli diplomacy and diplomats. Because of the special angle they use, especially worthy of mention at this time are the articles in this section by David Kimche, on foreign policy and morality, and by Meir Vardi on the universal and unique values that shape Israeli foreign policy.

It would be seemly if employees at other ministries were to follow in the footsteps of the Foreign Ministry people and publish similar volumes about their ministries. Elements in such volumes could cast light on an extremely important aspect of a democratic regime in the determination and implementation of policy, which usually does not earn sufficient coverage.

Mixed multicultural metropolis
Between the freewheeling lifestyle of Tel Aviv and the fraught sanctity of Jerusalem, Be'er Sheva represents another option. The many Bedouin living around the city and its large population of new immigrants offer the potential for turning the area into another sort of metropolis, if only the authorities would cease interfering

The vagaries of history and the great building momentum in Be'er Sheva have brought the old Muslim cemetery almost to the doorway of the new Negev Mall. In reality, the sight is less dramatic than this description, because the Muslim cemetery doesn't look like a cemetery at all. The entire area is covered with thick dry foliage, which conceals the low, rounded gravestones, and the visitor has no choice but to step on the graves hidden beneath them.

During our visit to the "Capital of the Negev," this problematic site served as the arena for a mini-drama. Musa Abu Ghanem, a Bedouin living in Be'er Sheva who is a professor of education in Achva College, refused to be photographed with the cemetery in the background. "As it is, this sight hurts me," he said in a choked voice. "Why don't they at least take care of the dead? After all, they won't start an intifada." Ora Rubchinsky, the coordinator of projects in the municipal absorption administration, who immigrated to Israel from the Ukraine six years ago, also refused to be photographed with the cemetery in the background. She was afraid that the photo would link her indirectly with the condition of the place.

But this tense situation shouldn't be seen as a metaphor for life in Be'er Sheva. Even though this tension is certainly a part of the fabric of life in the big city, it is not the essence of that life. In Be'er Sheva - with its 55,000 new immigrants from the CIS who in the past decade have joined the veteran population, which has a Mizrahi majority [Jews of North African and Middle Eastern origin], and with the 120,000 Bedouin who live in the surrounding area (about 5,000 of them, Bedouin and Arabs from the north of the country, live in the city itself) - the Israeli reality has the potential for constant friction. At the same time, it also signifies a great opportunity.

The capital of the Negev runs on this seam line with studied caution. Not for naught does the word "potential" repeat itself in almost every conversation with any of the city's residents. It seems that the distance from the center of the country and the sense of the marginality of living in the periphery embrace everyone with a bond of basic solidarity. Or at least with a need to get along with one another.

The Capital of the Negev has been lucky: Despite being "the city of our Patriarch Abraham," Be'er Sheva has not acquired any sanctity, of the kind which dominates everyday life in other places in Israel. A city of sand and of secularism, whose residents are interested in its well-being - for their own well-being - and dream of becoming the large metropolis of the south.

"There is certainly room for optimism here," says Prof. Oren Yiftachel, head of the geography department in Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. "There are many cultures here, which have not yet become hostile to one another as in Jerusalem; there is more gentleness, more of a flow, without concealing the existence of deprivation and exploitation, especially of the Bedouin.

"Be'er Sheva is a place to which many people have come by chance. This can be regarded with bitterness, but it can also be seen as a smooth meeting point between groups, because no one is really the owner. Even the suburb of Omer and the Bedouin all around it bear no resemblance to the story of Irwin Moskowitz and Ras al Amud [an Arab neighborhood in Jerusalem where the American millionaire has bought land for a Jewish housing project]," Yiftachel says.

Covert apartheid

Despite the criticism, there is a chance of turning the area into a true metropolis. Here, even the relative weakness of the residents - immigrants, Bedouin and Mizrahim - becomes an advantage. Any development and construction plan in Jerusalem brings hundreds of protests in its wake; the marina in Haifa has been involved in legal proceedings for 15 years. In Be'er Sheva, which has no sea, one could build a marina without any opposition. This weakness should be used in order to empower the populations.

"We also have to acknowledge the fact that this is a binational metropolis. That is of course the fear of the various `Liebermans' [a reference to the views of Transportation Minister Avigdor Lieberman], that most of the residents of the Negev, the Bedouin and the Russians, didn't come here to make the desert bloom, and their connection to the Negev as a Zionist project is weak," Yiftachel points out.

"The desire to make the metropolis Jewish and to leave the Bedouin in exile is covert apartheid, but even if at the moment there is a situation of creeping apartheid toward the Bedouin and the residents of the development towns, it can still be stopped. We have to break out of the mindset, and at a relatively small cost to Israeli society we can establish a different metropolis here."

From a drawer in his office at the university, Yiftachel pulls out a map of the planned boundaries of the metropolis for which he is a planning consultant. On the map there are Jewish settlements as well as several Bedouin settlements. But another map, photographed from the air, tells an entirely different story. Where there are empty spaces on the "planning map," the aerial map shows dozens of black dots that mark unrecognized Bedouin settlements, which merit recognition only from the air.

In one of these unrecognized settlements lives Ali Abu Rabia, head of Aljamahir, the Organization for Social and Cultural Advancement in the Arab Sector. Abu Rabia is now completing his master's degree in Middle Eastern history at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and every evening he returns to a house which is not connected to electricity or water."I enter Be'er Sheva every day as though I were entering my own home," Abu Rabia says, somewhat defiantly. "This is our city, that of Arabs and Jews, despite the efforts being made by the authorities to rewrite the history of the city and to erase any trace of its Muslim past."

At the entrance to the controversial mosque in Be'er Sheva's Old City, Abu Rabia points proudly and angrily to the museum building next to the mosque, a building constructed in 1906 as a seat of government for the district governor, a Turkish Muslim. "The entire museum has become Zionist-nationalist, without a single Muslim element," he says sorrowfully. "Why aren't we invited to participate in these things?"

Next to the closed mosque - the Islamic Movement is waging a stubborn battle to have it opened for prayers - Abu Rabia tells how his grandfather and his father used to come to prayers and tie their camels outside. "I don't understand how the opening of the mosque can harm a state that declares itself a democracy that believes in freedom of worship," he says. "They are so afraid of anything that will bring back anything characteristically Muslim to a city that was overwhelmingly Muslim."

"Aside from the Sharia court [of Islamic law], there is no real sign of a mixed city in Be'er Sheva," says Musa Abu Ghanem. "The establishment is making every effort to keep Be'er Sheva from turning into a mixed city. When I want to pray in a mosque on holidays, I have to travel outside the city."

Despite this, Abu Ghanem, a native of the state-sponsored Bedouin town of Tel Sheva, where he also served as the principal of the local elementary school, chose the option of living in Be'er Sheva itself. Three years ago he purchased a house in the new Ramot neighborhood in the city, a move about which he deliberated for a long time. Two of his five children are still studying in Tel Sheva "to give them foundations of language and culture." The older ones study in Jewish schools in Be'er Sheva.

"Maybe I am doing them wrong," says Abu Ghanem. "The transition to Be'er Sheva may give them better tools for the future, but on the other hand they are encountering another culture in a predatory society." Nevertheless, Abu Ghanem is satisfied with his new life in Be'er Sheva and with his Jewish neighbors, some of them families of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

"You need a lot of emotional strength for such a move," he says. "I am living in the manner that I have chosen to live, although I don't delude myself that I have become integrated. There are other Bedouin families in the neighborhood, and there is no tension. In Be'er Sheva there isn't the wickedness that there is in other mixed cities. The immigrants from Russia, even though most of them are right-wing, have brought about a certain moderation in the city, and have contributed to its multicultural mosaic. If they stop treating the Bedouin like a strategic threat, a real metropolis for everyone can grow here."

Contemporary comparisons leap out at you, page after page, day after day, in this diary of mounting horrors in prewar Germany, no matter how vast the differences

"Sippur Shel Germani, 1914-1933" ("Geschichtes eines Deutschen") by Sebastian Haffner, Hebrew translation, notes and epilogue by Shulamit Volkov, Khargol Books, 202 pages, NIS 69

Is there any basis for comparison, however slight, between the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the state of affairs in Israel today? Should we compare? Is it allowable? Is only the Israeli right entitled to use Nazism to set up such historical analogies as Saddam-Hitler, Arafat-Hitler, Udi Adiv's parents-Adolf Eichmann's parents, even Marwan Barghouti-Hitler, or can we do so, too, to the extent that the analogy fits? No honest Israeli can read Sebastian Haffner's book without asking himself these preliminary questions.

I read the book twice. Once while waiting for America to launch its nefarious attack on Iraq, and again as the war raged. Israel's occupation of the territories was at one of its cruelest stages ever, and Israeli public opinion, at one of its most obtuse. "Sippur Shel Germani" ("A German's Story") left me pondering some troubling issues long after I put it down. Contemporary comparisons leap out at you, page after page, day after day, in this diary of mounting horrors, no matter how vast the differences.

Haffner's journal, let us remember, ends in 1933, as the monstrous Nazi regime comes to power - before World War II, before the mass murders, before the most horrifying genocide in history, to which nothing can be compared. It should also be borne in mind that there are different degrees of evil. The fact that the Nazis were the devil incarnate does not mean that other horrors perpetrated by mankind in our world - among them the Israeli occupation - are of no significance.

Even Prof. Shulamit Volkov, who deserves our highest praise for translating this book and making it accessible to the Israeli public, wrote: "After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, fears for the future of democracy in Israel reawakened. A comparison with the Weimar Republic became unavoidable" ("Minorities and Other Strangers," Am Oved). And no one can accuse Volkov of being an enemy of Israel.

Thus comparing Germany of the 1920s and early `30s to Israel at the start of the third millennium is not only permissible but imperative - for gaining an insight into how barbarous regimes develop, grasping the differences (and there are many profound ones), and discerning the similarities, which ought to worry us.

In this country, we don't execute people for their opinions. We don't even fire them for that reason. There is no ideology supportive of genocide, and even transfer is opposed by the overwhelming majority of Israelis. But we do arrest people without trial. We do throw people who have not been accused of anything into mass detention centers, if not concentration camps. We do keep people locked up in their cities and villages, if not ghettos. We do discriminate between Arabs and Jews in every sphere. We do build roads that only Jews can use and are guilty of violating the most basic human rights - in the territories but also west of them. So why shouldn't we compare? How can we not?

Raimund Pretzel (Sebastian Haffner's nom de plume), born in Berlin in 1907, was just the right age when the Nazis came to power. He was in his twenties, a law student, not a very political person, a member of the middle-class, living in the shadow of portentous events and trying not to take part in them. Like almost everyone of his generation, he could have been swept up in the ugly tide. He could have become an active Nazi, a counsel for the defense of the death industry, a little cog or a big cog. He could have stood on the sidelines, or built a quiet little career for himself and kept his mouth shut, or run away from it all. Or he could have gone to the other extreme and voiced opposition.

For several years, Haffner's choice was clear: to sit still, to hold his nose and carry on. He did not participate in the odious goings-on, but neither did he protest. It is hard to argue with such an approach. Many of his countrymen chose a much viler course of action. Haffner at least registered what was going on around him. He suffered in silence, but suffer he did.

Haffner's choice, until he fled, is the choice of many Israelis. Half an hour from our homes, an entire people lives under lock and key. There are apartheid roads and wholesale assassinations. The killing of innocents has become a matter of routine. Masses of people are arrested without trial and incarcerated in detention camps under the most appalling conditions. But we don't know about it. We don't hear about it. We don't see it. And we don't want to. We want to carry on, living our petty lives as best we can, keeping our heads down.

But Haffner soon realized that he could not go on this way. That, perhaps, is the most important lesson in the book. One cannot remain on the sidelines forever, neither participating nor putting up a fight, just sitting on the proverbial fence, if only for practical reasons: The mechanism of evil has a way of sucking people in. It swallows all. Even Haffner, the law student, not a Nazi at all, finds himself marching daily behind the swastika-emblazoned flag, in an army uniform and high boots, sporting a Nazi armband, in an ideological indoctrination camp that all law students must attend in order to qualify for their degree.

It was only for a few weeks, and he tried to march on the sidelines, so as not to be directly behind the flag, but he was still a little Nazi, a Nazi for the day. "Until today, my mind reels at the memory. In that scene lies the essence of the Third Reich," writes Haffner in this memoir, penned in 1939, before the horror erupted in full, when he himself was already far away, in another country (he lived in exile in Paris until 1954).

Haffner was clearly not proud of his actions; his heart gave him no rest. Perhaps that is why he shelved the book and it ended up being published only posthumously, in 2000. In Germany, it was an immediate bestseller. Haffner must have had good reason for ending the book with this story of the Nazi training camp. He does not tell us what else he did before going into exile. A refusenik he wasn't. "What should I have said?" he asks himself, as some of us may ask ourselves one day. "If they had suddenly demanded deeds, would I, or someone like me, have known what to do? If war had erupted then and there, and we were sent to the front, just like that, to fight for Hitler - what then? Would I have thrown down my gun and deserted? Would I have turned around and shot the person beside me - the fellow who had helped me clean the gun just yesterday? ... I sighed and forced myself to stop thinking. I realized I was trapped. I should never have come to this camp."

Feeling trapped, he blocks his thoughts and concludes that he should never have been there in the first place. "Maybe I should have objected right away, on the first day, when they distributed the armbands," he writes. "I could have said: `No, I will not put it on,' and trampled the armband under foot. But that would have been crazy. Worse than that, it would have been ridiculous. I would have ended up in a concentration camp instead of Paris, and broken the promise to my father that I would pass my exams."

But Haffner knows the bitter truth, at least in retrospect: "In the back of my mind, there is a little nagging voice. Nothing can help. Whatever you say, that swastika was on your arm." The comparison that begs to be made? The dilemma of whether or not to serve in the territories, to stand at an army checkpoint in the role of the hard-hearted jailer, cruelly keeping women, children, sick and old from getting through - or saying no and being hauled off to prison.

Haffner promised his father he would pass his tests. But the biggest test of them all - the moral test - he passed only in part, even in his own eyes. At the last minute, he jumped off the bandwagon and saved himself from sliding down the slippery slope. It was an individual act of courage, the act of one person in a crowd. If he were proud of his deeds, he would have published the book in his lifetime. If he were ashamed of them, he would have destroyed it. Haffner was neither the worst of the Germans nor an object of pity. He was a little German, who ran away and did not lend a hand to the approaching Holocaust.

Haffner's book is a brave attempt to explain why he was sucked into the inferno and how he escaped by the skin of his teeth, when it was almost too late. In the end, Haffner's solution - running away - inspires respect. His sincere doubts and misgivings, the reader feels, are those we should rightly expect from all ethical persons.

Haffner explains how his generation grew up on the excitement of war: "A grand, thrilling game, a game between nations that could be deeply satisfying and produce stronger emotions than anything peace could offer - that was the daily experience of ten graduating classes of German school children, and it was this which became the clearest and most basic vision of Nazism."

Did anyone around here notice how excited many people were as the war on Iraq drew near? How the generals sat in television studios, their eyes gleaming, urging America to get moving already, as if they couldn't wait for the action to begin? Haffner writes that opponents of the war were regarded as party- poopers. Sound familiar? And this: "As the war [i.e. World War I] went on for four years, I lost all sense of what peace was."

A word on courage: "Civilian courage, i.e., the courage to reach an individual decision and assume personal responsibility, is a very rare commodity in Germany, as Bismarck once remarked. This type of courage eludes Germans the moment they don a uniform." What about Israelis?

How do we feel, reading a passage like this: "Nowhere was there such a gigantic carnival of death, such a grotesque, blood-soaked festival of saturnalia, in which not only money lost its worth but every human value. The year 1923 prepared the Germans not so much for Nazism as for a nightmarish adventure." And this: "It was heartless insanity and blind, arrogant certainty that led them into the abyss, the belief that `justice is that which serves our aims,' and there is no such word as `impossible.' A nation cannot cross that line and emerge emotionally unscathed."

Haffner describes the "last days of Pompeii" of Germany in the 1920s - how the young people danced and sang, and the rich grew richer, and the number of beggars multiplied. Ring a bell? They, too, had a brief interlude of peace that inspired hope. The Stresemann era, 1924-1929, was something like Oslo: "People went back to living their private lives, cordially invited to conduct their affairs as they saw fit and find their own way of being happy. But then something odd happened. ... The public turned down the invitation. No one was interested."

Haffner misses the years when Berlin was an internationally open city and he even had a Turkish tennis partner. "Every time I think about it, it amazes me. It is hard to say what is more unconceivable today: that such a thing was possible in Berlin only ten years ago, or that it could all disappear without a trace within the span of ten years."

Reading these lines takes me back to the time when Marwan Barghouti and other Palestinian council members flew to Europe together with a group of ten Israeli MKs, among them representatives of Shas and the Likud. That was also less than ten years ago, and today we can hardly imagine it.

"Few things are more ridiculous than the calm, remote manner in which I, and others like me, observed the events around us, as if we were spectators at the theater," writes Haffner - a remark that should prompt some disturbing thoughts in any Israeli with a conscience. Haffner goes on sipping wine with his girlfriend, and when the Nazis evict all his Jewish colleagues from the Supreme Court, he continues to peruse files in the library. Only in hindsight does he ask: "Why didn't anyone get up spontaneously and object? Why didn't they protest, if not against everything, then at least against some specific injustice, some unfair incident that took place in their midst?"

During lunch break, the justices of the Supreme Court continued to chew their sandwiches in silence after greeting the young Nazi judge who had been appointed against their will. They were not bad people; they were just small people. Haffner considered leaving the civil service. He thought about converting to Judaism. But it was all talk. "I went on living in my bubble, like millions of others. I allowed things to go on happening, and they did." Does the fact that he was dealing with much greater atrocities than anything known in this country mean that we are not guilty of the same sin?

Haffner's account of parting from his childhood friend, Frank Landau, is heartrending. He and Landau, a Jew, ran together in events organized by the Old Prussia Sprinting Association. They went to high school and university together. They discussed their love life. They met nearly every day for 17 years, until Haffner came to help Landau pack up and leave, and two Nazi officers appeared at the door.

A news broadcaster disappeared. Jewish actors vanished one by one from the theater. And no one protested. By the autumn of 1933, Haffner's circle of friends was gone. Hassel had left for America; Bruck and Holtz had joined the Nazi party. "I saw people I had been friendly with turn into murderers," he writes.

Haffner devotes a brilliant chapter to friendship, the kind sanctified in blood: "Camaraderie and war are linked. Like alcohol, it is a kind of consolation to those who find themselves in inhuman conditions ... Camaraderie corrupts human beings more than alcohol or opium ... worst of all, camaraderie frees man from responsibility for his own life ... He does what everyone does. He has no choice. He has no time for reflections ... His conscience are `his friends,' and as long as he continues to do what they do, he is assured a full pardon for all his sins."

When, since the appearance of our own Song of Camaraderie [Shir Hare'ut], has anyone in this country written anything so blunt and so subversive? Will anything like it ever be written?

British teaching union rejects boycott of Israeli academics
By The Associated Press	| May 9, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
LONDON - A British teachers' union rejected a proposal Friday to have British universities sever all ties with Israeli academic institutions to protest Israel's alleged violation of the rights of Palestinians.

Two-thirds of the 200 delegates at the annual conference of the Association of University Teachers rejected the proposal.

"Members are urged to attend no academic conferences in Israel, and not to participate as referees in hiring or promoting decisions by Israeli universities, or in the decisions of Israeli funding agencies," the proposal said.

Sue Blackwell, a lecturer in the English department at Birmingham University who proposed the motion, told the delegates in Scarborough, northeastern England, that just as Britain had boycotted South Africa it should impose one on "today's apartheid regime."

She claimed that from its inception Israel had attracted international condemnation by violating United Nations resolutions and the Geneva Conventions regarding the rights of the Palestinians and of going to war with its neighbors.

"The question for us is what we can do to show our disgust at this abhorrent regime," she said. "There has been half a century of human rights abuses by Israel. Isn't it time we took some action?"

However, most of the delegates voted "no" after Alan Waton, an executive member of the 46,000 strong association, warned that such a boycott would be counterproductive to the union's aims.

He said there were many Israelis within universities in Israel who sympathized with the Palestinians and that links with those people should be fostered rather than severed.

"We should work as closely as possible with those progressive forces in Israel and Palestine to hasten the day when there are two independent, democratic, free states," Waton said.

He said that unlike the boycott of South African goods and products, a boycott of state-funded universities in Israel would not be effective.

Delegate Simon Renton of University College London said the imposition of a boycott would be "intolerant, arrogant and imperialistic."

"We will only be cutting off support with the people with whom we have most sympathy and that would be absurd," he said. "This is a model of self-harm which we ought not to follow."

Following the vote, a spokesman for the Association of University Teachers praised the delegates for deciding that the best way to resolve the complex situation in Israel was "to pursue dialogue, not boycotts."

Before the vote, the International Academic Friends of Israel, an activist group based in New York City, issued a statement condemning the motion, saying its proponents "join an increasing number of global scientists and academics who are using the politics of the Middle East as an excuse to boycott and ostracize their Israeli counterparts."

Last year, hundreds of European academics called a boycott of Israeli universities to protest the treatment of the Palestinians, a move that led to the firing of two Israelis from British publications and prompted allegations of discrimination and intellectual censorship.

Thus comparing Germany of the 1920s and early `30s to Israel at the start of the third millennium is not only permissible but imperative - for gaining an insight into how barbarous regimes develop, grasping the differences (and there are many profound ones), and discerning the similarities, which ought to worry us.

In this country, we don't execute people for their opinions. We don't even fire them for that reason. There is no ideology supportive of genocide, and even transfer is opposed by the overwhelming majority of Israelis. But we do arrest people without trial. We do throw people who have not been accused of anything into mass detention centers, if not concentration camps. We do keep people locked up in their cities and villages, if not ghettos. We do discriminate between Arabs and Jews in every sphere. We do build roads that only Jews can use and are guilty of violating the most basic human rights - in the territories but also west of them. So why shouldn't we compare? How can we not?

Raimund Pretzel (Sebastian Haffner's nom de plume), born in Berlin in 1907, was just the right age when the Nazis came to power. He was in his twenties, a law student, not a very political person, a member of the middle-class, living in the shadow of portentous events and trying not to take part in them. Like almost everyone of his generation, he could have been swept up in the ugly tide. He could have become an active Nazi, a counsel for the defense of the death industry, a little cog or a big cog. He could have stood on the sidelines, or built a quiet little career for himself and kept his mouth shut, or run away from it all. Or he could have gone to the other extreme and voiced opposition.

For several years, Haffner's choice was clear: to sit still, to hold his nose and carry on. He did not participate in the odious goings-on, but neither did he protest. It is hard to argue with such an approach. Many of his countrymen chose a much viler course of action. Haffner at least registered what was going on around him. He suffered in silence, but suffer he did.

Haffner's choice, until he fled, is the choice of many Israelis. Half an hour from our homes, an entire people lives under lock and key. There are apartheid roads and wholesale assassinations. The killing of innocents has become a matter of routine. Masses of people are arrested without trial and incarcerated in detention camps under the most appalling conditions. But we don't know about it. We don't hear about it. We don't see it. And we don't want to. We want to carry on, living our petty lives as best we can, keeping our heads down.

But Haffner soon realized that he could not go on this way. That, perhaps, is the most important lesson in the book. One cannot remain on the sidelines forever, neither participating nor putting up a fight, just sitting on the proverbial fence, if only for practical reasons: The mechanism of evil has a way of sucking people in. It swallows all. Even Haffner, the law student, not a Nazi at all, finds himself marching daily behind the swastika-emblazoned flag, in an army uniform and high boots, sporting a Nazi armband, in an ideological indoctrination camp that all law students must attend in order to qualify for their degree.

It was only for a few weeks, and he tried to march on the sidelines, so as not to be directly behind the flag, but he was still a little Nazi, a Nazi for the day. "Until today, my mind reels at the memory. In that scene lies the essence of the Third Reich," writes Haffner in this memoir, penned in 1939, before the horror erupted in full, when he himself was already far away, in another country (he lived in exile in Paris until 1954).

Haffner was clearly not proud of his actions; his heart gave him no rest. Perhaps that is why he shelved the book and it ended up being published only posthumously, in 2000. In Germany, it was an immediate bestseller. Haffner must have had good reason for ending the book with this story of the Nazi training camp. He does not tell us what else he did before going into exile. A refusenik he wasn't. "What should I have said?" he asks himself, as some of us may ask ourselves one day. "If they had suddenly demanded deeds, would I, or someone like me, have known what to do? If war had erupted then and there, and we were sent to the front, just like that, to fight for Hitler - what then? Would I have thrown down my gun and deserted? Would I have turned around and shot the person beside me - the fellow who had helped me clean the gun just yesterday? ... I sighed and forced myself to stop thinking. I realized I was trapped. I should never have come to this camp."

Feeling trapped, he blocks his thoughts and concludes that he should never have been there in the first place. "Maybe I should have objected right away, on the first day, when they distributed the armbands," he writes. "I could have said: `No, I will not put it on,' and trampled the armband under foot. But that would have been crazy. Worse than that, it would have been ridiculous. I would have ended up in a concentration camp instead of Paris, and broken the promise to my father that I would pass my exams."

But Haffner knows the bitter truth, at least in retrospect: "In the back of my mind, there is a little nagging voice. Nothing can help. Whatever you say, that swastika was on your arm." The comparison that begs to be made? The dilemma of whether or not to serve in the territories, to stand at an army checkpoint in the role of the hard-hearted jailer, cruelly keeping women, children, sick and old from getting through - or saying no and being hauled off to prison.

Haffner promised his father he would pass his tests. But the biggest test of them all - the moral test - he passed only in part, even in his own eyes. At the last minute, he jumped off the bandwagon and saved himself from sliding down the slippery slope. It was an individual act of courage, the act of one person in a crowd. If he were proud of his deeds, he would have published the book in his lifetime. If he were ashamed of them, he would have destroyed it. Haffner was neither the worst of the Germans nor an object of pity. He was a little German, who ran away and did not lend a hand to the approaching Holocaust.

Haffner's book is a brave attempt to explain why he was sucked into the inferno and how he escaped by the skin of his teeth, when it was almost too late. In the end, Haffner's solution - running away - inspires respect. His sincere doubts and misgivings, the reader feels, are those we should rightly expect from all ethical persons.

Haffner explains how his generation grew up on the excitement of war: "A grand, thrilling game, a game between nations that could be deeply satisfying and produce stronger emotions than anything peace could offer - that was the daily experience of ten graduating classes of German school children, and it was this which became the clearest and most basic vision of Nazism."

Did anyone around here notice how excited many people were as the war on Iraq drew near? How the generals sat in television studios, their eyes gleaming, urging America to get moving already, as if they couldn't wait for the action to begin? Haffner writes that opponents of the war were regarded as party- poopers. Sound familiar? And this: "As the war [i.e. World War I] went on for four years, I lost all sense of what peace was."

A word on courage: "Civilian courage, i.e., the courage to reach an individual decision and assume personal responsibility, is a very rare commodity in Germany, as Bismarck once remarked. This type of courage eludes Germans the moment they don a uniform." What about Israelis?

How do we feel, reading a passage like this: "Nowhere was there such a gigantic carnival of death, such a grotesque, blood-soaked festival of saturnalia, in which not only money lost its worth but every human value. The year 1923 prepared the Germans not so much for Nazism as for a nightmarish adventure." And this: "It was heartless insanity and blind, arrogant certainty that led them into the abyss, the belief that `justice is that which serves our aims,' and there is no such word as `impossible.' A nation cannot cross that line and emerge emotionally unscathed."

Haffner describes the "last days of Pompeii" of Germany in the 1920s - how the young people danced and sang, and the rich grew richer, and the number of beggars multiplied. Ring a bell? They, too, had a brief interlude of peace that inspired hope. The Stresemann era, 1924-1929, was something like Oslo: "People went back to living their private lives, cordially invited to conduct their affairs as they saw fit and find their own way of being happy. But then something odd happened. ... The public turned down the invitation. No one was interested."

Haffner misses the years when Berlin was an internationally open city and he even had a Turkish tennis partner. "Every time I think about it, it amazes me. It is hard to say what is more unconceivable today: that such a thing was possible in Berlin only ten years ago, or that it could all disappear without a trace within the span of ten years."

Reading these lines takes me back to the time when Marwan Barghouti and other Palestinian council members flew to Europe together with a group of ten Israeli MKs, among them representatives of Shas and the Likud. That was also less than ten years ago, and today we can hardly imagine it.

"Few things are more ridiculous than the calm, remote manner in which I, and others like me, observed the events around us, as if we were spectators at the theater," writes Haffner - a remark that should prompt some disturbing thoughts in any Israeli with a conscience. Haffner goes on sipping wine with his girlfriend, and when the Nazis evict all his Jewish colleagues from the Supreme Court, he continues to peruse files in the library. Only in hindsight does he ask: "Why didn't anyone get up spontaneously and object? Why didn't they protest, if not against everything, then at least against some specific injustice, some unfair incident that took place in their midst?"

During lunch break, the justices of the Supreme Court continued to chew their sandwiches in silence after greeting the young Nazi judge who had been appointed against their will. They were not bad people; they were just small people. Haffner considered leaving the civil service. He thought about converting to Judaism. But it was all talk. "I went on living in my bubble, like millions of others. I allowed things to go on happening, and they did." Does the fact that he was dealing with much greater atrocities than anything known in this country mean that we are not guilty of the same sin?

Haffner's account of parting from his childhood friend, Frank Landau, is heartrending. He and Landau, a Jew, ran together in events organized by the Old Prussia Sprinting Association. They went to high school and university together. They discussed their love life. They met nearly every day for 17 years, until Haffner came to help Landau pack up and leave, and two Nazi officers appeared at the door.

A news broadcaster disappeared. Jewish actors vanished one by one from the theater. And no one protested. By the autumn of 1933, Haffner's circle of friends was gone. Hassel had left for America; Bruck and Holtz had joined the Nazi party. "I saw people I had been friendly with turn into murderers," he writes.

Haffner devotes a brilliant chapter to friendship, the kind sanctified in blood: "Camaraderie and war are linked. Like alcohol, it is a kind of consolation to those who find themselves in inhuman conditions ... Camaraderie corrupts human beings more than alcohol or opium ... worst of all, camaraderie frees man from responsibility for his own life ... He does what everyone does. He has no choice. He has no time for reflections ... His conscience are `his friends,' and as long as he continues to do what they do, he is assured a full pardon for all his sins."

When, since the appearance of our own Song of Camaraderie [Shir Hare'ut], has anyone in this country written anything so blunt and so subversive? Will anything like it ever be written?

People and Politics / Sharon's Bantustans are far from Copenhagen's hope
The former Italian prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, said that three or four years ago he had a long conversation with Sharon, who was in Rome for a brief visit. According to D'Alema, Sharon explained at length that the Bantustan model was the most appropriate solution to the conflict.

During his visit two weeks ago to Israel, former Italian prime minister Massimo D'Alema hosted a small group of Israelis - public figures and former diplomats - to a dinner at a Jerusalem hotel.

The conversation quickly turned to the conciliatory interviews Prime Minister Ariel Sharon gave to the press for their Independence Day editions. One of the Israelis, of the type for whom it's second nature, no matter who is in government, to explain and defend Israeli policy, expressed full confidence in Sharon's peace rhetoric. He said the prime minister understands the solution to the conflict is the establishment of a Palestinian state beside Israel.

The former premier from the Italian left said that three or four years ago he had a long conversation with Sharon, who was in Rome for a brief visit. According to D'Alema, Sharon explained at length that the Bantustan model was the most appropriate solution to the conflict.

The defender of Israel quickly protested. "Surely that was your personal interpretation of what Sharon said."

D'Alema didn't give in. "No, sir, that is not interpretation. That is a precise quotation of your prime minister."

Supplementary evidence backing D'Alema's story can be found in an expensively produced brochure prepared for Tourism Minister Benny Elon, who is promoting a two-state solution - Israel and Jordan. Under the title "The Road to War: a tiny protectorate, overpopulated, carved up and demilitarized," the Moledet Party leader presents "the map of the Palestinian state, according to Sharon's proposal." Sharon's map is surprisingly similar to the plan for protectorates in South Africa in the early 1960s. Even the number of cantons is the same - 10 in the West Bank (and one more in Gaza). Dr. Alon Liel, a former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, notes that the South Africans only managed to create four of their 10 planned Bantustans.

The Bantustan model, says Liel, was the ugliest of all the tricks used to perpetuate the apartheid regime in most of South Africa's territory. By 1986, unrest in the Bantustans turned into ongoing rioting and terror, which descended into coups in the so-called independent regimes, and South African intervention. The minuscule support the Bantustan governments did enjoy evaporated, so by January 1994, they were finally dismantled and became integrated into the united South Africa of black majority rule.

No country recognized the Bantustans nor did any drop embargoes against South Africa. But veteran leaders of the black struggle against apartheid remember that business people from Israel and Taiwan were the only foreigners who developed business relations with the Bantustan governments. The permission given to the largest of the Bantustans, Bophutatswana, to open a diplomatic office in Tel Aviv infuriated American opponents of the apartheid regime, including Senator Ted Kennedy, and some of the Jewish congressmen of the time.

An Israeli who spent many years nurturing Israeli relations with Africa was also at the dinner hosted by the Italian prime minister. He said that whenever he happened to encounter Sharon, he would be interrogated at length about the history of the protectorates and their structures.

Powell as Uriah

Presumably, the CIA has got its hands on a copy of the instructions sent to Israel's foreign legations on how to explain Israeli policy regarding "The Middle East after Saddam Hussein." After all, the document received only low-level classification.

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell could have saved himself the trip to Jerusalem by reading in it what he heard in the Prime Minister's Office on Sunday:

"Israel accepts the central principles presented in President Bush's speech of June 24, 2002, and regards them as the basis for the continuation of the political process. Israel welcomes any `road map' that matches the above-mentioned presidential vision and which will lead to its implementation on the basis of a new and different Palestinian leadership and implementation of the reforms there."

The document also said that all the commitments are conditioned on the test of a Palestinian campaign against terror.

That, more or less, is what Sharon told Powell.

A strange argument broke out between the two, however, over their interpretations of Bush's "vision." Sharon argued the road map is not a precise translation of the "vision," which is the only peace plan the prime minister has accepted.

Powell, who just happens to be the person who was appointed by Bush and gets his salary from Bush's government, replied that actually, the president thinks the road map is a faithful reflection of his vision.

Now, all that's left is to ask Bush why he sent his ambassador to Israel, Daniel Kurtzer, to Jerusalem two weeks ago, to give the Israeli prime minister a copy of a peace plan that does not reflect the president's vision.

Between the lines, the leader of the free world should be insulted. In effect, the prime minister is saying the president did not notice he was hoodwinked by the Quartet, including Powell, who sold him a road map that leads somewhere Bush did not intend to go.

As published here three weeks ago, Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin has already told the members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations that British Prime Minister Tony Blair hypocritically seduced Bush into adopting the Quartet road map. Rivlin did not invent the idea of Bush falling into a plot laid by Blair. Rivlin picked it up at the highest levels of Israel's government, where he also picked up that his primary mission in New York was to kill the map, softly or not.

In the summary of the notes on the autopsy of the dead Powell mission, the Foreign Ministry made the following distinction: Powell was like the biblical Uriah the Hittite, sent by King David into battle. But an experienced general like him is not a sucker. He understood the map could turn him into the scapegoat of the Christian neo-conservatives and the opportunistic Jewish busybodies. The Foreign Ministry's assessment is that Powell will tell the president something along these lines: "I was deeply impressed by the readiness of the two sides to put an end to the age-old conflict between them. This is your opportunity to put another feather in your crown. Your involvement is more important than ever, for that, so I recommend you name a special presidential envoy to implement your vision."

Confirmation of that can be found in Powell's decision meanwhile to postpone the appointments of the supervisors meant to implement the road map. State Department staffer Richard Erdman, who was designated to head the team, has a piece of paper saying he's the next ambassador to Algeria. Powell's assistant, David Satterfield, has meanwhile been asked to stay here only until the weekend.

The non-governmental formula

A few hours before Powell's plane landed here, a not-very-large group of Israelis and Palestinians who have already expressed support for the road map, lined up at passport control to leave for Copenhagen. Among the Israelis were MK Haim Ramon and former minister Uzi Baram, former MKs Dalia Rabin-Pelossof and Abdul Wahab Darawshe, Maj. Gen. (res.) Shlomo Gazit, Dr. David Kimche and Reuven Merhav, two former directors-general of the Foreign Ministry. Along with authors Sami Michael and Amos Elon, businessman Dov Lautman, former ambassador Avi Primor and Nadia Hilu from Na'amat as well as a group of academics, they were all signing onto a declaration of peace rare in its content and the composition of its signatories.

Under the rubric of the International Alliance for Arab-Israeli Peace (The Copenhagen Group), the Israeli group joined a group of Palestinian security officials and public personages, ex-generals and business people from Jordan, and former diplomats and writers from Egypt. Their joint declaration said: "The peace forces in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Palestine have agreed to join hands to work together for the mobilization of the Arab and Israeli peoples and world public opinion to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East."

The conference participants prepared a short and simple peace formula for their governments: "United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 1397, and the Arab Peace Initiative (the Saudi Initiative) adopted by the Arab League Summit in Beirut in March 2002, especially the principle of exchange of full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories of 1967 for a full peace, normal relations and security arrangements not only between Israel and the adjacent states but with the Arab world; Security for both sides, starting with an end to all violence; Respect for human rights, international humanitarian law, and the environment; Evacuation of all settlements in all areas occupied in 1967, excluding those that are included in land swaps; Agreed borders based on and equal to June 4, 1967; Jerusalem as the capitals of two independent states."

The "right of return land mine" was dismantled with the following interesting formulation: "A just and agreed upon solution of the refugee problem consistent with the Palestinian determination for the fulfillment of all relevant UN resolutions including UN General Assembly Resolution 194 and with the Israeli determination to maintain the Jewish nature of the State of Israel, without prejudice to the Arab population of Israel and according to the bilateral peace agreement."

The "alliance" members agreed, "Peace is too important to be left only to governments."

Powell's return to Washington without an Israeli signature on the road map is evidence that it's also impossible to trust the most powerful government in the world. The crises afflicting Meretz and Labor and the silence in Shinui on all the issues regarding the peace process, show that peace cannot be left to the political parties.

On the Palestinian side, meanwhile, the tension between Yasser Arafat and Abu Mazen has also been a bad influence on the dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian peace groups. To remind everyone who's the boss, Arafat is delaying the launch of the Nusseibeh-Ayalon initiative, and for the same reason, the Beilin-Abed Rabbo agreement, which has Abu Mazen's support, is also suffering from takeoff problems.

Now, it's your turn
F.W. de Klerk, the man who led South Africa out of apartheid and into democracy, draws a comparison between the situation in his country and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and recommends negotiations, even while under fire.
By Aviva Lori	| May 16, 2003 | 12:00 AM

CAPETOWN, South Africa - On the day after Amram Mitzna resigned from the leadership of the Labor Party, the position was offered to Frederik de Klerk. On a spacious porch overlooking a beautifully kept golf course and the deep blue waters of a small bay, Israelis and Palestinians ringed de Klerk and asked him how to go about making peace.

De Klerk of course didn't take seriously the idea of replacing Mitzna, which was proposed - with an equal lack of seriousness - by two Knesset members, Yuli Tamir (Labor) and Eti Livni (Shinui), but he did take very seriously the question about making peace. Taking a deep puff on a cigarette, he smiled and said: "Peace is made very simply. You sit down and talk. That's what my friends and I did after the famous Parliament speech on February 2, 1990."

The meeting of Israelis and Palestinians with de Klerk took place last week in South Africa, in a charming resort town not far from Capetown, in the form of a seminar on methods of achieving peace in conflicted societies. The gathering was organized by the South African Human Sciences Research Council headed by Prof. Wilmot James, a sociologist, author and fighter against apartheid. Funding was by the Ford Foundation. It was not a political meeting, or one of the hundreds of encounters between Israelis and Palestinians who travel abroad for a weekend to let off steam. Nor was it what the journalist and confidant of Ariel Sharon disparagingly called it on Israel Radio, "a few people who went to compare the situation in the territories with apartheid." It was above all a forum for listening.

The list of invitees to the seminar included key figures in South Africa - cabinet ministers, members of parliament, businessmen, journalists, clerics and other public personalities - headed by de Klerk, who was president of South Africa from 1989 to 1994 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (jointly with Nelson Mandela in 1993). The participants from South Africa, although unabashedly proud of their political achievements, did not come to preach or to draw comparisons between their situation and the Israeli situation or to suggest instant solutions. They talked about the crisis of the 1980s, the international isolation, the sanctions, the shame of identifying oneself as a South African, the violence, the bloodshed, the political power struggles, the arrests, the pain and the despair - but also about the light at the end of the tunnel: the transition from apartheid to democracy.

De Klerk, the man who led South Africa to democracy, has been invited to come to Israel next month, to attend a summit meeting of former leaders who will talk about peace. Ehud Barak will be there, he says, as well as Mikhail Gorbachev, and de Klerk, who is a member of the International Board of the Peres Center for Peace, will try to find time in his very busy schedule to attend. (De Klerk heads an international foundation that assists conflicted societies.)

De Klerk, who since leaving political life in 1997 has been available for international missions, sees the Israeli- Palestinian conflict as a personal window of opportunity, as a possible way to bolster his status in South Africa, too. Here many people say cynically that in his famous speech in Parliament in 1990, de Klerk did not really intend to release the democratic genie from the bottle, based on a genuine, deep belief. But after he set the process in motion, events dragged him in their wake.

Why apartheid failed

What happened on February 2, 1990? De Klerk recites the plot as though it were a well-made thriller. That morning he prepared for his annual address marking the opening of the new session of Parliament. The day before, he wrote the speech in longhand but, unusually, did not give the draft to his secretary for typing. Afterward he convened a few close friends and told them about the contents of the speech along general lines. Later that day, he met with the cabinet and informed them of his intentions.

"I didn't want this leaked to the press, so I made them promise, because usually they do leak, not even to talk to their wives, and I promised not to tell my wife, and for once we kept the secret because we wanted maximum impact of the announcement so that we could change the whole attitude of the South Africans and the rest of the world to see that this was serious and we were not playing games."

At midnight, de Klerk called Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister, and told her that she would not be disappointed by the speech he was going to deliver the next day. De Klerk's wife, Marike (who was brutally murdered in December 2001), drove him to Parliament the next day, and said to her, "`South Africa will never be the same again,' and she understood," de Klerk said.

De Klerk's speech started the snowball of democracy rolling in South Africa. He announced that the Communist Party, which was fiercely hated by his Afrikaner National Party, would be granted legal recognition, that all political prisoners who were not found guilty of violent crimes would be released, that all executions were being suspended, and that Nelson Mandela would be released from prison unconditionally in ten days.

To ask a South African today where he was on February 2, 1990, when de Klerk spoke, is like asking an American where he was at the time of the Kennedy assassination or an Israeli where he was when Yitzhak Rabin was shot. Most blacks and coloreds will reply that on that day they were in the midst of a struggle of one kind or another against apartheid, and most whites will say that not only did they know long before that day that the end of apartheid was looming, but also that they believed the apartheid regime was immoral and unjust. Along with apartheid itself, it turns out, most of its supporters vanished, as though they had never existed. The collective memory has undergone a metamorphosis: Everyone was a supporter of Mandela.

De Klerk, 67, was born in Johannesburg to an Afrikaner family of public figures and politicians. He studied law and worked as a lawyer for 12 years. In 1973, he passed up a prestigious academic appointment to pursue a political career, having been elected to Parliament in November, 1972. He steadily climbed the political ladder in the National Party - which had been in power since 1948 and had introduced the apartheid laws - until 1989, when the president, P.W. Botha, had a stroke and resigned, and Parliament chose de Klerk to succeed him.

The question that most intrigued the Palestinians, the Israelis and, surprisingly, the South Africans at the seminar, was what had caused de Klerk's transformation. What induced a politician with such a conservative background, who grew up and lived in a rigid climate of establishment racism, to make a complete about-turn?

In his reply, de Klerk, paints the past in today's shades: "When I was a young man and supported apartheid the idea was to partition South Africa and to offer to each identifiable nation, with its own language, its own culture, its own royal families, an independence which at the end would form some sort of a confederation as the European Union was once. In other words, in a sense, what apartheid originally wanted to achieve is what everybody now says is the solution for Israel and Palestine, namely - partitioning, separate nation states on the bases of ethnicity, different cultures, different languages."

If it was so good, why did it fail?

"In our case it could not work because of demographic realities and our totally integrated economy. The majority of the blacks said this is not how we want our rights, we prefer to have our rights in one united country. The white South Africans wanted too much of the land and were not prepared to give up enough in order to ensure that the black nation would be economically viable. Thus, the possibility of partitioning became unachievable and impracticable."

Negotiating under fire

De Klerk talks about the need for new thinking in connection with the Jewish-Arab conflict, while emphasizing the differences between South Africa and the Middle East.

"There is no other solution between Israel and Palestine than to negotiate and compromise, which is meaningful and fair to all parties concerned. I do not know of any conflict which has been resolved without meaningful negotiation."

When he talks about the South African experience, his criticism of the Israelis and the Palestinians is evident: "We negotiated under fire. South Africa was burning with violence, but no one allowed himself the luxury of believing that we could wait with the negotiations until the violence ceased."

Did the isolation and the international sanctions help you decide?

"The tragic thing about sanctions was that it hurt people it was intended to help most. The lack of economic growth did not result in higher unemployment among the whites, but it did among blacks. It did not hurt the middle and high income groups, but it did hit the lower income groups very hard and had a profound effect on unemployment.

"Isolation played an important role - for example, South Africans are keen sportsmen. Being excluded from international competition such as the Olympic Games had a profound effect. Scientific isolation also played a very important role in mobilizing the academic world towards becoming politically active; suddenly the doors of the universities and libraries were closed to our bright students, which stimulated and motivated advocates of change. But this isolation also had a counter effect for some years because it increased the patriotism in white South Africans, who felt: We will not allowed them to dictate to us."

De Klerk's decision to change direction was also influenced by the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989. Until then, he says, he was paralyzed by fear of a Communist takeover in South Africa and in the neighboring countries.

In South Africa, people say that it was neither the fear of Communism, internal or external, nor a farsighted approach that led de Klerk to embark on the right historical road. It was, they say, something as simple as a love story, a transformation he underwent at the age of 60, when he fell in love with Elita Georgiades, the wife of a Greek tycoon with interests in South Africa and a supporter of de Klerk's party. After a secret love affair, he cut himself off from her for three years, but in the end they both got divorces, de Klerk after 39 years of marriage. Today he and Elita are married, and de Klerk guards his private life zealously.

Sanctions don't always help

Thoughts about love did not accompany the end of the first day of the seminar. Instead, spontaneous joy erupted in dance. Maybe this is what peace is supposed to look like. Palestinians, Israelis and Africans breached the barriers, joined hands and danced. Everyone let it all hang out, including the finance and education ministers of South Africa. Both Israelis and Palestinians said South Africa has cause for rejoicing. When de Klerk heard about the dancing and the pessimistic feelings of some of the Israelis and Palestinians, he said, "Sometimes when things look at their darkest, then the light is near."

The former white minority governments of de Klerk and his predecessors had good relations with the governments of Israel, even when the international community imposed sanctions on South Africa. It was an alliance of outcasts. The blacks and their leader, Mandela, had close ties with the Palestine Liberation Organization. An alliance of the oppressed. Now a governmental attempt to create a balance is under way in South Africa.

"Yes, the Israelis helped us cope with the international sanctions. There were countries that helped us because not all countries supported the concept of sanctions.

"But today there is more objectivity in our relations with Israel. Yes, traditionally Israel had good relations with South Africa, which was the first country to recognize the State of Israel. And it is logical to say that basically there is more closeness between the present South African government and the Palestinians; before, it was a closer relationship between the old government and Israel."

Do you think Abu Mazen will be the Mandela of the Palestinians?

"I am not expert enough to express such an opinion. I sincerely hope that we can help Israel and Palestine out of the deadlock."

And can Sharon be the de Klerk of the Israelis?

"That would be difficult for me to comment on. You have to work with the leaders you have. You can not import leaders, you have to create them."

Between Mandela and Barghouti

Heribert Adam, a native of Frankfurt, has been studying Israeli and South African nationalism for many years. He teaches political sociology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and at the University of Capetown, specializing in nationalism, ethnic conflicts, collective memory and how societies cope with crimes and traumas from the past. His connection with South Africa began in the apartheid period, when he fell in love with a South African of Indian origin on one of his visits to the country for academic purposes, and afterward married her.

"When it turned out that the law forbade me from even meeting with her, not to mention living together, we decided to leave South Africa and settled in Canada," he says. "Although I must admit that at first there was something magical about it - the fact that we had to hide and outwit the authorities - it was the excitement of those who bite into forbidden fruit."

Since the end of apartheid, he has been a regular visitor to South Africa. The seminar was shaped largely on the basis of his academic model: Peace-making in divided societies. In one of his lectures at the seminar he jolted everyone by stating that he prefers a "binational state" to "two states for two nations," and then attacked the Palestinians for the bad public relations they are doing for their cause.

Does the binational concept have a chance in Israel?

"I am aware of the fact that at the moment the idea has no chance in Israel, even though in my opinion it could crop up in one of the next stages of the negotiations. But I don't find it illogical at all. Taking into account the fact that your economy is so dependent on theirs and that both economies are in such dire straits today, that dependence makes political independence almost completely unimportant.

"The Palestinian state that will emerge will not be able to provide even the minimum requirements of the population from any point of view, and certainly not territorially, because there is no hope that the settlements will be evacuated. On this subject I am not optimistic at all, and in the end it will lead to one state, of a binational character.

"In that case, I would even say: Why shouldn't the settlers stay there and the Palestinian government not be at least as tolerant of them as the Israeli government is toward the Palestinians who live within its borders?"

Adam doesn't think that Sharon is going to become a new de Klerk or a new de Gaulle anytime soon. "At the moment he is more like President Botha" - under whom apartheid in South Africa reached a peak.

Is there any chance that Abu Mazen will one day be Nelson Mandela?

"I doubt it. Everyone who is openly supported by Israel and the United States is a leader who is forced on the Palestinians, and therefore will not have broad support. But perhaps others, perhaps some who are now in prison, such as Marwan Barghouti, have a chance of becoming Mandela."

Adam's advice to the Palestinians is to replace their PR. "Until they recognize Israel's legitimate existence and until they change their public relations in the international media, and stop sounding as though they are preaching anti- Semitism, nothing will happen. They have to come out openly against the suicide bombers and encourage a discussion in the Arab states to recognize a legitimate Jewish state."

The burning house parable

When Pallo Jordan, minister of environmental affairs and tourism in the Mandela government, and now a member of Parliament and chair of its Foreign Affairs Committee, spoke, silence reigned in the hall. Perhaps it was the expectation that a black leader, a senior member of the African National Congress and a highly regarded politician, would preach morality to the government of Israel. Instead, Jordan turned to the Palestinians and suggested that they stop making use of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the anti-Semitic forgery concocted by the Russian secret police 100 years ago.

"The Palestinians have no chance of succeeding if every Jew in Israel thinks that the only thing that is going to happen is that the Palestinians are going to blow them up," Jordan said afterward. "The intelligent thing to do is to persuade the Israelis that a Palestinian state, when it is established, will not pose a threat to them. The Palestinians mustn't forget the trauma of the Jews of Europe. If they don't learn Jewish history, about the pogroms and the Holocaust, and don't recognize the suffering the Jewish people has endured, and don't free themselves of the anti-Semitic context that their comments create, there is no way they will succeed in promoting their legitimate interests, from the point of view of public relations."

The African National Congress party traditionally supported, and continues to support, the Palestinians, Jordan notes. "But we are fair enough to tell them that they are doing themselves damage by the violent methods they are using. On the other hand, I have no great expectations that Ariel Sharon will be the person who makes peace or will change his approach."

How did you succeed in neutralizing the enmity, the anger and the hatred that all of you must have felt for the whites?

" Anger gets you nowhere. You have to talk, to put down the gun and talk, to listen to what the other side has to say. If the other side speaks to the point, listen to them. That's what people who use their brains, and not their blood, do. Think where you want to go and then go there. What's the problem? Decide who you are, as Israelis, and what they, as Palestinians, want, and then use your brains to think how you get there."

The vanished
A flawed film on Argentina's past blames the wrong party
By Noga Tarnopolsky	May 20, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Spring is film festival time. This year, among others making the rounds is Israeli filmmaker Nurit Kedar's documentary "Asesino."

The film, which was shown at the Brooklyn Jewish Film Festival and at the Toronto Jewish Film Festival on May 7, presents itself as an angry testimonial to the injustice committed against Argentine Jews whose family members "disappeared" under the brutal military regime of the mid-1970s. Yet it is unclear what Kedar intends to achieve with "Asesino." Her focus is unmistakably on the vanished Argentine Jews and on the comportment of the State of Israel, yet, astonishingly, she does not address the question of Argentine anti-Semitism.

In fact, unsuspecting viewers would be forgiven for coming away from this documentary with the conclusion that German Nazis set up a second Auschwitz in central Buenos Aires 30 years ago.

In a sequence about halfway through this hour-long film, Adolf Hitler's voice is heard exhorting unseen masses as the camera pans over what appear to be holding cells in an Argentine torture center. In the next scene, an unidentified woman, a blonde seemingly in her early 60s, is shown on screen. "Auschwitz was terrible," she says. "They'd take you to showers and not tell you what it was. People didn't have hair. At one point I turned to a woman next to me and said, `The only thing I want is to find my mother,' and that woman was my mother. I didn't even recognize her."

The next shot is of vicious soldiers in elaborate uniforms goose-stepping past Argentine generals.

Shortly after the sequence outlined above, an unidentified, Israeli-accented male voice says, "This was not long after the Holocaust. Where were our antennas?"

Blaming Israel

Kedar, who won the award for outstanding Israeli filmmaker at the 2002 Jerusalem Film Festival, has ostensibly set out to tackle an important topic, the disappearance of thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of Argentine citizens under the brutal military regime that ruled the nation from 1976 to 1983. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of the desaparecidos, as the disappeared are known in Spanish, were Jews. Research has shown that they were not sought out specifically because of their Jewishness (the Argentine military had the Stalinesque ambition to rid the nation of leftists, intellectuals and thinkers - in short, anyone who could be defined as "subversive") but were treated significantly worse than non-Jews when in detention.

It appears that Kedar's central contention is that the State of Israel backed Argentine neo-Nazis who systematically murdered Jews. In this way she imbues this crime with a layer of irony and depravity lacking even in the original sin of Europe's Holocaust.

The film repeatedly presents testimony uttered by unidentified and often unseen individuals. Some of the most shocking accusations are made by invisible specters, including the claim that Jewish youngsters in Argentina were killed by Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns and that former prime minister - and Holocaust survivor - Menachem Begin was aware of this fact. The nameless, faceless voices of Kedar's film offer numerous accusations against the State of Israel and against specific functionaries - former ambassador Dov Schmorak, former prime ministers Begin and Yitzhak Shamir and even Ariel Sharon - with no rebuttals or contextualization.

The inventory of "voices" and their names that scroll up at the end of this film is meager compensation for the annoyance of viewing a documentary in which anonymous voices, on occasion making egregious mistakes, prevail. In one tangential but characteristic moment, Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges, who perennially heads lists of great writers denied the Nobel, is referred to as "the Nobel Prize winner."

Bilateral relations between Israel and Argentina during the 1970s comprised a complex web. Israel did in fact sell arms to the Argentine generals; for years, Shamir addressed this subject by explaining that Argentina, like apartheid-era South Africa, was a "devil" with which Israel found itself obliged to deal in arms in order to guarantee the survival of its indispensable military industry.

But while no Israeli citizens were killed during the military regime, Israel developed a policy of handing out false passports to individuals - Jewish or not - who managed to flee detention centers or who felt their lives were in danger. Israel's embassies in Buenos Aires and in Santiago, Chile, functioned as de facto nerve centers for those needing to escape, and in this way hundreds of lives were saved. No other country comported itself in a comparable manner.

A Swedish teenager, Dagmar Hagelin, "disappeared" in Argentina, and Sweden did nothing. Four French nuns vanished without a trace, and France was silent. Kedar does not mention them; indeed, she seems oblivious of huge swaths of history.

A tragic choice

The most galling deficiency in this film is the absence of Rabbi Marshall Meyer, who goes unmentioned in "Asesino." Meyer, the American-born spiritual leader of Buenos Aires Congregation Beit El, was Argentina's Raoul Wallenberg. Tall and charismatic (perfect, in fact, for a filmic account), Meyer rescued hundreds of lives and the dignity of Argentina by speaking out, by absconding with threatened youngsters and, yes, by handing out those life-saving Israeli passports. His absence from this film is incomprehensible.

Although no Israeli citizens were lost during Argentina's darkest years, among the disappeared was Mauricio Fabian Weinstein, an 18-year-old native Argentine who carried an Israeli document by virtue of having briefly immigrated to Israel as a child.

His parents, Marcos and Clara, who moved the family back to Argentina before the 1976 coup, serve as the central characters of this flimsy effort, and are the only witnesses named. The Weinsteins' story would be typical of that era if not for the young man's dual citizenship and one other, horrifying detail: Faced with an armed mob at home, Marcos was forced to direct the military kidnappers to the clinic in which his son, a left-wing activist, was hiding. Opening the door to let the murderers in, he saw his son for the last time. "I had begged him," Marcos says of his son, "to leave the country, not to make me choose."

"My wife and daughter were at home with guns to their heads," he says.

Over the years the Weinsteins have often blamed Israel for not acting to save their son's life, in some cases going so far as to blame the Jewish state and not Argentina for their tragedy. In "Asesino," Marcos recounts with acid satisfaction an episode in which he accused an Israeli official of complicity in his son's death; perhaps Mauricio was killed by being thrown from an Israeli-made Arava jet. "Nice, eh?" the heartbroken man asks Kedar's camera, overcome by cynicism.

In these moments the film "Asesino" feels not like a failed effort but like an extended case of abuse, both for the viewer and, even less fortunately, for the figures portrayed within.

Living outside of history
If we don't do all we can to prevent South Africa from taking place here, we will be forced in the end to set up a binational state. None of the inhabitants of the region will want it, but by then it will be too late.
By Yuli Tamir	| May 21, 2003 | 12:00 AM

On their return from a visit to South Africa, some two weeks ago, members of the Israeli-Palestinian delegation asked themselves a number of questions: How is that South Africa extricated itself from the cycle of hostilities, while we are still there? How did former South African president F.W. de Klerk, with whom the delegation met, go from being the leader of an extreme nationalist party, which was openly affiliated with the notions of Spanish fascism and Nazism, to being a leader who believes in the establishment of a civil and equal state? How did the negotiations manage to create a new political reality that is allowing South Africa to begin, albeit significantly late, to deal with its real problems - poverty, disease and ignorance?

The story of South Africa is the story of a country that tried to exist outside of history and found out that history had the upper hand. In 1948, the year the National Party took power, Burma, Sri Lanka and South Africa rid themselves of the yoke of British colonialism. The world after World War II began to demand self-rule for nations that colonialism had oppressed. The Boers in South Africa did not see themselves as a colonial offshoot, but rather as emissaries of God who had been sent to spread Christianity in the Promised Land.

"The holy mission," which was, in fact, an attempt to take control of a country rich in natural resources and disinherit its original inhabitants, tried to rest not only on messianic principles, but also on international ones. It was not by chance that de Klerk relied on Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points, which served as the basis for international recognition of the principle of national self-determination.

In South Africa, however, the self-determination of the Afrikaners did not give rise to liberty, but rather to the oppression of the black natives of the country, oppression that the National Party anchored in law. In the 19th century, it would have worked; but for the second half of the 20th century, it was a non-starter. Following the fall of Nazism and fascism, there was no going back. The Afrikaners refused to heed the spirit of the times.

So as to moderate the international pressure, South Africa tried to establish homelands, which were intended to restore to the blacks the political rights they had had taken from them. The map of these homelands - tiny, divided, lacking the ability to survive economically - reminds South Africans of the map of Areas A and B that the settlement-oriented right is trying to market as the permanent status map. The world didn't buy South Africa's solution.

In response, instead of affiliating itself with the world of American values, South Africa affiliated itself with America's paranoia - the fear of the spread of communism. In such a manner, the South African Communist Party and the struggle in Namibia became the final excuse against handing over power to the blacks. But then the Soviet Empire collapsed.

South Africa became the most hated and isolated country in the world. "I knew that every day saw the birth of a child who grew up to hate South Africa," de Klerk says. The hatred, the sanctions, the internal pressure from businessmen who saw the international markets closing in their faces, and the fear of a civil war like that of Rhodesia gave birth to the change. "We could have rehabilitated the country we love or we could have been dragged into a war that would have destroyed us all. We chose life."

The story of South Africa is, to a certain degree, our story. The State of Israel is not an apartheid state. The likeness stems from the way in which Israel is trying to swim against the historic tide and freeze time, while attempting to use global fears to delay the end. Just as South Africa held on to the anti-communist fear, so Israel is resting today on the fear for Islamic terror. Just as in the case of South Africa, so too in the case of Israel is there a basis for the fear, and therefore delaying the inevitable is possible; but the price is huge.

South Africa returned to the family of nations and began to rehabilitate itself decades late, and hence the rehabilitation is slow and costly. In Israel's case, the price could turn out to be even higher. The day fear of Islamic terror dissipates, and the powers that be in Israel reach the conclusion that there is no alternative but to give the Palestinians a state, a division will be impossible. The process that kept the Afrikaners from dividing South Africa, while keeping the majority of the natural resources for themselves, and obliged them to equally share with the peoples of the land not only the natural resources but the entire territory, establishing a single equal country, could happen here, too.

The Israelis and the Palestinians do not want a binational state, but time doesn't stand still. The intentional mixing of the populations that the settlers are striving for; the attempt to give the Palestinians a small and divided state; the economic dependency; the erosion of the Palestinian infrastructure; and, as a result, the destruction of their ability to establish a stable country could throw everything into disarray.

If we don't do all we can to prevent South Africa from taking place here, we will be forced in the end to set up a binational state. None of the inhabitants of the region will want it, but by then it will be too late.

The scent of racism
Separate lines for Jews and Arabs have long since become second nature here. There is no need to go as far as the occupied territories - where apartheid roads for Jews only and curfew for Arabs only have long been the reality - in order to witness the separation. It's here, within the country.
By Gideon Levy	| May 25, 2003 | 12:00 AM

Shock is the proper reaction to the remark of cabinet Minister Gideon Ezra, who explained last week that Arabs should be used as security guards in Israel because only they have "the sense of smell needed to smell other Arabs, more so than guards who are immigrants from the former Soviet Union."

If anyone in Europe dared to say something similar about Jews, the world would be outraged, and rightly so. Another possibility is to ignore what Ezra said: What's the relevance of a low-life utterance from a marginal minister whose level of speech only casts a gloomy light on the institution he came from, the Shin Bet security service, and on his current place at the cabinet table?

On second thought, though, we should be thankful to Ezra: He has provided an apt description of the reality in which we live. We do in fact "sniff out" Arabs, all of whom are suspect in our eyes solely because of their ethnic origins.

We are all racists. Like it or not, we live in a reality of national, not to say racist, separation. A fusion of genuine security distress, the appalling terrorist attacks in the cities, the moral scars we bear as a result of decades of occupation and the faulty education we received has created a day-to-day reality here that can only shock anyone who believes in human rights.

However, we have grown accustomed to the situation and our eyes have become dim. We have grown used to seeing citizens who are made to say something, so that security guards can judge how much danger they pose on the basis of their accent. That has become entirely natural. Racism is here, but we continue to imagine that we live in a highly enlightened and progressive society.

Now Ezra has come and inadvertently held up the mirror in front of us. And what it reflects is ugly. After all, what's the difference between trying to sniff out Arabs as Ezra would do, and making passersby speak in order to see whether they have an Arab accent? An "oriental" look or an Arab accent, dark skin or traditional dress immediately create serious suspicions.

That may be understandable, but we must also be aware of the serious implications of such behavior. A society that classifies its residents according to their origin and is impassive about this behavior cannot be a just society.

The more incendiary manifestations of racism, such as the despicable obscenities you can hear at any soccer game, are the direct and inevitable continuation of this acceptance of the situation. And we haven't yet mentioned the discrimination in budgets and civil rights.

It is very difficult to be an Arab in Israel today, whether a citizen of the state or a resident of the territories.

Every Arab is considered a suspicious object unless he can prove otherwise. A few weeks ago, Dr. Mohammed Darawshe, a citizen of Israel from the Givat Haviva Institute for Advanced Studies, the education center of the Kibbutz Artzi movement, wanted to take a plane from Eilat to Tel Aviv. He had to answer dozens of impertinent and nosy questions about the purpose of his trip - and only because of his ethnic origin. There was no connection between the questions he was asked (Where did you lecture? What was the subject? Why did you come to Eilat?) and any sort of danger that was liable to accrue because of his presence on the plane. But Dr. Darawshe is an Arab, and Arabs have to be interrogated at every opportunity. It is more than likely that Darawshe will not forget the humiliating experience he underwent in Eilat for a long time, even if it's a matter of routine.

Separate lines for Jews and Arabs have long since become second nature here. There is no need to go as far as the occupied territories - where apartheid roads for Jews only and curfew for Arabs only have long been the reality - in order to witness the separation. It's here, within the country.

Under the aegis of the security situation the phenomenon has grown to worrisome proportions, far beyond what's necessary. Arab students find it difficult to rent apartments in Jewish cities solely because of their ethnic origin and without any security justification.

The country's Arab citizens are increasingly loath to venture out of their towns and villages because of the suspiciousness and humiliation they encounter in every contact with Jewish citizens or with the authorities. It is precisely because of the security needs, which sometimes oblige this sort of separation and discrimination, that unnecessary manifestations of discrimination should be reduced as far as possible.

The result is that a Jewish generation has grown up that has no experience or knowledge of contact with Arab society on an equal basis. To this generation, every Arab is only a potential danger that must be fought, and this even before the draft and the corrupting army service in the territories.

At the same time, an Arab generation has grown up that is aware of the apartheid and unwilling to accept it (along with the new generation in the territories, which knows only the armed Israeli who enters his home violently). The Arab-Israeli student, who is thrown out of a discotheque because of his accent or the way he looks, will not soon forget this situation.

In the United States, where there are similar phenomena, the civil rights organizations went mute after September 11, 2001. Now, every person whose name has a Muslim ring to it is a citizen under suspicion. And no one speaks out against this. Quite a few Muslim citizens of the United States have taken American names. In this sphere let us not take an example from the U.S. and let us not abandon ourselves to racism in the name of security.

So we have to be grateful to MK Ezra, who with his crude language, exposed the naked truth. Yes, we do sniff out Arabs.

If the government says the earth is flat
Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has invented a wonder drug for the right of return issue - he's forbidden ministry officials to talk about it.
By Akiva Eldar	| May 27, 2003 | 12:00 AM

Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has invented a wonder drug for the right of return issue - he's forbidden ministry officials to talk about it. Shalom now explains to every visitor that international law doesn't recognize the right of return. That was what he told French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin who asked if Israel would be ready to accept 40,000 Palestinian refugees. In his pocket, Shalom had a fresh government decision that said the solution to the refugee problem will not include Palestinian refugees being allowed to settle inside Israel.

If de Villepin was a visitor from Mars, he might have been tempted to believe that 40,000 Palestinian refugees could undermine the entire demographic balance inside Israel and the territories under its control. But presumably, before taking off from Paris, his aides provided him with critical data on the disputed land, like, for example, that some 100,000 Palestinian babies are born every year in the West Bank and Gaza, many into refugee families and thereby acquiring refugee status. While Israel invents wonder drugs and concoctions to prevent refugees coming in from outside the country, more Palestinians than Jews are entering the territory under its control between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea.

The demographic threat

There are even those in the army who are more worried about the demographic threat than the terror threat. One of them, Colonel Ephraim Lavie, who recently left the IDF, said it bluntly last week. In recent years, Lavie - a former senior officer in Military Intelligence's research department and an adviser on Palestinian affairs in Ehud Barak's peace team - has been exposed to the most comprehensive raw intelligence available on the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. In a lecture at the Peres Center for Peace he pointed to what he called "signs of a movement that will demand a return to the one state for two peoples'" idea.

The officer, whose doctorate from Tel Aviv University deals with Palestinian civic society, said the members of the new Palestinian movement reject the PLO's official position, which calls for a "two states for two peoples" solution. They are aware the demographic factor is working in the Palestinians' favor. The South African model, of apartheid ending peacefully and without a civil war, seems to them to be relevant to settle conflicts based on ethnic disputes. "The immediate significance," Lavie warned, "could be that motivation to reach a peace agreement with Israel will be very low among Palestinians."

Lavie draws a conclusion that challenges the very foundations of his former superior officer, Major General Amos Gilad, as well as the arguments presented by Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon. Unlike them, he proposes regarding the demographic process, and not terror, as an existential threat, and that the political positions for negotiations with the Palestinians should derive from that demographic threat. As opposed to Gilad and Ya'alon and most Israeli politicians, Lavie proposes an approach that does not regard the right of return as an obstacle to any agreement.

Lavie finds no support for the Ya'alon-Gilad camp's thesis that the age-old Palestinian plot to turn the Greater Land of Israel into the Greater Land of Palestine is behind the Palestinian insistence on the right of return. "On the eve of Oslo, the Palestinian leadership was aware there was no chance Israel would accept the right of return element," says Lavie. "The Palestinians believed it would be possible to reach an agreement based on providing `an appropriate solution' to the refugee problem - in the sense of recognizing in principle the right of return, but with a limited application, based on agreement with Israel. That was their position consistently until the advanced stages of the negotiations for a permanent agreement and created the feeling or illusion on the Israeli side that it would be possible to reach a solution for all the 1967 problems without dealing with the 1948 problems through the right of return."

According to Lavie, Arafat - and Abu Mazen - are committed to the Palestinian National Congress' decision of 1988 that accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242, "which means a historic national decision to make do with a smaller part of Palestine (22 percent). Nonetheless, both are committed to the PNC decision to `close the '48 file' on the basis of UN General Assembly Resolution 198." Those decisions remain applicable as long as the PLO institutions don't change them. That's what they went with to the Madrid Conference, the Oslo agreement and the permanent status negotiations. Presumably, says Lavie, that's also what they will take to the third phase of the road map.

The former senior adviser to the Israeli negotiating team revealed that on the eve of the Camp David summit, in the Stockholm channel used by Shlomo Ben-Ami, Gilad Sher and Abu Ala, "there were signs of a solution to the refugee problem through a replacement and/or compensation, with a small number of refugees returning to Israel under this or that definition, and there was even a new formulation of `the right of return' narrative, that could satisfy both sides." But, said Lavie, as the two sides reached the end of their great effort to reach the two states for two peoples solution, they found themselves, surprisingly, taking more extreme positions and going back to the most difficult issues of the origins of the conflict, the right of return and the historic "crime," as the Palestinians define it.

Lavie's explanation for that retreat is that Israel regarded Camp David as a decisive summit, and its message to Yasser Arafat was "It's now or never." That's why it pressed him to accept the "end of the conflict" and in effect to explicitly renounce the right of return - something the PLO institutions never approved and Arafat was not authorized to decide on his own.

"When it turned out there was no chance of reaching an agreement, the sides turned their positions to the extremes," says Lavie. "Arafat's position was presented as a deliberate attempt to undermine the existence of Israel, and to drop the two states for two peoples solution. In effect, however, those were not principled positions, impossible to compromise over, but positions with a hidden tactical agenda: to lay the blame for anticipated failure on the other side."

Lavie says Camp David was a failure waiting to happen because there was no agreed basis for the negotiations. The Palestinian view was that the negotiations were meant to lead to fulfillment of rights that were objectively derived from what they referred to as "international legitimacy," meaning all that derived from UN decisions, including UNGA Resolution 194 about the return of the refugees.

And since those were "rights," they could not be compromised. On the other side, Israel regarded the basis for negotiations as persuading the Palestinians that accepting the plan would be good for them, too. That's why the Israelis wanted to move away from the issue of international legitimacy, even though it accepted UNSCR 242 as the basis for the negotiations. "Those were contradictory approaches that created a `failure of communication' between the sides and an essential difficulty in the negotiations."

Finally, Lavie also challenges the prevailing view in the army and political arena that Arafat deliberately planned the transition from the failed Camp David summit to all-out war. Lavie says the anger directed at Israel in the intifada was the expression of frustration in Palestinian society, over the political and social management style of the leadership. "Arafat made a bad judgment decision, and believed that a limited conflict could actually play into his hands, as a way to pressure Israel. He failed to throw his full weight behind an end to the fighting, because he wanted to internationalize the conflict and create an alternative political process to the one that failed at Camp David."

Summarizing, Lavie assumes that there won't be a political solution that the Palestinians will ever be able to regard as a final end to the conflict. "That doesn't mean that it's a zero-sum game as far as Israel is concerned because any agreement that removes the demographic hunchback will be better than no agreement."

PM would deny citizenship to children with Palestinian parent
The prime minister and defense heads have requested an amendment to the Citizenship Law to prevent automatic Israeli citizenship for a child with a Palestinian parent.

The prime minister and defense heads have requested an amendment to the Citizenship Law to prevent automatic Israeli citizenship for a child with a Palestinian parent.

The move follows the discovery that the suicide bomber who blew himself up at the Mazza restaurant in Haifa was the son of a Jewish mother and a Palestinian father. The bomber had automatically received Israeli citizenship and this aided him in moving freely and carrying out his attack.

Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein has informed Prime Minister Ariel Sharon he is in favor of the amendment.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has sent a sharply-worded letter to Rubinstein that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of nationality and race, especially when it refers to a child born to one Israeli and one Palestinian parent.

Labor party secretary general, Ophir Pines-Paz, described the initiative as "a bad joke" and said Sharon was using it to counteract the reactions in the Likud to his support for the road map. Pines-Paz said the amendment would be anti-constitutional and racist. "It distinguishes between one type of blood and another," he said.

Balad MK Azmi Bishara said the amendment would make Israel "the only country in the world since the fall of apartheid where people are discriminated against on the basis of their blood and their origin." Sharon's initiative "puts his words about a Palestinian state in another light; his motive is merely racial segregation," he said.

The latest political joke in the cafes of Damascus Gate says that Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) invited Arik Sharon to a well-known ancient steam bath in Nablus. Sharon went in first and asked how much it costs. The owner said he sets the price according to how much soap and water the customer needs. It will cost you NIS 50, he said, looking Sharon over. Then came Abu Mazen and asked how much it costs. The owner looked him up and down and said NIS 100. Abu Mazen was insulted. Why did you ask Sharon for only NIS 50 and charge me NIS 100? he asked. Because you're dirtier, said the owner.

Abbas' standing in the Palestinian street and perhaps among the masses in the Arab world is at its lowest. In light of grassroots Arab hostility to Israel and the U.S., Abbas is perceived as someone who was carried into his office on the shoulders of the Bush administration and the Sharon government. He knows it and is not seeking to become a popular leader. But he also understands he won't be able to do his job without a certain degree of recognition and legitimacy from the residents of the territories.

That's the background to his talks with Hamas two weeks ago. The discussions are supposed to resume this week, apparently after Abbas returns from the Arab-American summit in Sharm al-Sheikh. An understanding with Hamas is the key to his success or failure. If the talks succeed, then the way will be paved to renewing the political process with Israel.

No less important is achieving the public stature he needs, through the Hamas leadership.

Many in the territories were surprised by the success of a meeting he had with the four Hamas political leaders in Gaza: Abdel Aziz Rantisi, Mahmoud Zahar, Ismail Abu Shnab and Ismail Haniyeh. He's been negotiating with Hamas for close to a year, but mostly via overseas contacts in Cairo, with the mediation of Gen. Omar Suleiman, and they so far proved unsuccessful. Hamas leaders from overseas, and not Gazans, were the contacts there, and overseas Hamas, led by Haled Mashal, is considered much more extreme and hard-line than the local Gazan leadership. Abu Mazen did not win a cease-fire agreement from Mashal and his colleagues six months ago, and not even a temporary truce, the Islamic hudna so often mentioned in recent weeks.

Abbas' relations with Hamas appeared to deteriorate during the formation of his government a month ago, when he spoke of plans to impose law and order and collect illegal weapons. Hamas leaders reacted angrily. "There is no weapon more pure and legal than the weapon meant to defend our land and its holy sites," said Haniyeh, for example. Hamas says attacks by its bombers are a defensive measure against the Israeli occupation, and for some, the latest round of attacks is the Hamas response to the demand they disarm.

Infuriating

What really infuriated the Hamas and the general Palestinian public was the open Israeli demand that the Abbas government use force to suppress Hamas. That is perceived as an Israeli demand for a Palestinian civil war. "Israel wants the Palestinian government to fight, dismantle, arrest and kill anyone who dares ask a question about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land," said the Jerusalem Times in a weekend editorial.

But the conversations with Hamas went well because Abbas did not demand they hand over their weapons. He sought an arrangement for an end to attacks on civilians and a broader end to all violent activity. Hamas leaders say Abbas treated them respectfully. He briefed them on the latest political developments and reported on his talks with Colin Powell and Sharon. He explained his political program, based on the road map, and they apparently were impressed by his sincerity and frankness.

In any case, at the weekend, there were a string of statements from Hamas leaders in Gaza about their conditions for a lull in the violence. Even the most extreme of the spokesmen, Rantisi, chose relatively moderate terms. Has their position really changed? It's very possible Abbas convinced them to give his political program a chance, and it's very possible Hamas is feeling the pressure from the international community and the Arab regimes on extreme Islamic groups. That pressure increased dramatically after the terror in Riyadh and Morocco. The pressure forced Syrian President Bashar Assad to take steps to silence (relatively) the activity of the Palestinian opposition groups in Damascus. It forced Iran to restrain Hezbollah in South Lebanon. It's very possible it made Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Rantisi, and their colleagues in Gaza, change their attitude somewhat to Abbas.

Either way, it's been difficult to spot Hamas critiques of the road map in recent days. Yassin can call the road map a trap, but nearly the entire Palestinian political leadership regards it as one of the greatest Palestinian political achievements. None of the dozens of politicians, academics and commentators who wrote and spoke about the road map in recent weeks has opposed it. But nearly all say its chances of success are slim, because the Israeli government will foil it. Everyone, from Yasser Arafat and Abbas, down to the editorial writers in the press, declared that the real test of the plan will be whether the Israeli government takes steps to implement it.

The Palestinian media meanwhile continued its routine reports on the steps Israel is taking to sabotage the chances for political progress. A special emphasis was put on phenomena that in Palestinian eyes are proof of increasing racism in Israeli policies. Much publicity was given to the amendment to the law proposed by Sharon and the defense establishment that would deny Israeli citizenship to anyone with a parent who is a Palestinian resident of the territories. The front pages of the newspapers carried pictures of Israeli soldiers taking the fingerprints of Arabs they stop in the streets of East Jerusalem. There was a lot of prominence given to the report from the Central Bureau of Statistics that some 300,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union are not Jewish. And there were Palestinian reports on how Sharon retracted his use of the term "occupation," and there were more reports on the "apartheid fence" that Israel is building on the border it is unilaterally creating in the West Bank, and the "Berlin Wall" it is building to divide the Arab community in Jerusalem. "The Israeli government is trying to turn the road map into an Israeli project," said one of the Palestinian political leaders who like many in the territories, is now waiting anxiously for the results of the important political meetings that President Bush will hold in the Middle East this week.

Judeophobia - not your parents' anti-Semitism
Is a new hostility toward Jews emerging in Great Britain?
By Barry Kosmin, Paul Iganski	Jun. 3, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Is there a `new anti-Semitism' in Britain? And if there is, where is it? These are the questions, among others, tackled by a new book, "A New Antisemitism? Debating Judeophobia in 21st Century Britain," published by JPR, the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, London. It contains essays by a cross-section of Jewish thinkers in Britain - writers, academics and other experts - including Peter Pulzer, Melanie Phillips, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Jonathan Freedland, Robert Wistrich, Anthony Julius, Winston Pickett and Howard Jacobson.

The book challenges the impression given by many commentators - especially in the United States - that a singular, pan-European virus of anti-Semitism has infected European countries. Yet scratch the surface of that notion and even a cursory analysis of the problem shows a different picture: what's happening in Britain is not the same as it is in France, in Germany, or elsewhere in Europe for that matter. In addition, there has been little in-depth and focused analysis on Britain, as distinct from her European neighbors - until now. It is this analytic gap that "A New Antisemitism?" seeks to fill. Along the way it also challenges some of the current conceptions about present-day anti-Semitism.

Where is it?

The first place that many look for anti-Semitism is on the streets. Certainly it's the seeming upsurge in violence against Jews that has exercised many commentators. But it's important to step back and take a more careful look: Historically, violent anti-Semitism has been associated with social and economic dislocation and political crisis, as in Weimar Germany. Yet at the start of the 21st century, Britain has a low level of unemployment, a strong currency, low inflation and social and political stability. British Jews as individuals also face little economic and occupational discrimination: they have above-average socio-economic status, having achieved prominence in the commercial, professional, artistic and public life of the nation out of all proportion to their numbers.

To be sure, recent history still casts a dark shadow. The violence of Kristallnacht and its portents understandably resides in the collective memory of many Jews when thinking about Europe. Look again, however: The moral climate of the 1930s was the result of a right-wing animus that fed directly into the economic, racist and biological components of anti-Semitism.

In present-day Europe, "Nazi style" anti-Semitism - both in its ideology and its manifestation - has been dealt with. Legislation has eliminated the armbands and the brown shirts. Occupational discrimination by means of racial hierarchies and Nuremberg-style laws are no longer a threat. Modern science has all but permanently discredited theories of biological racial superiority.

Not on the streets

Nor are there particularly new strains of violent anti-Semitism to be found on British streets. To be sure, malevolent synagogue and cemetery desecrations in Swansea, Finsbury Park and, most recently, in Plashet East London have received widespread media attention. Yet a closer analysis of the data reveals a different phenomenon. The rise in hate crimes against Jews in the last couple of years shows the number of recorded incidents to be a very weak indicator of the prevailing national climate of anti-Semitism.

In absolute terms, anti-Semitic incidents are still low when compared with the number of racist incidents recorded by law enforcement authorities. This is not to diminish the impact of such acts of violence. Even a single racist incident can terrorize a community. But the number of recorded incidents hardly suggests a climate of explosive hostility - at least at the moment. Moreover, such "street anti-Semitism" fits a familiar pattern. In recent years violent acts against Jewish targets have fluctuated in tandem with media coverage of events in the Middle East. More revealing still is that fact that a consistent level of street anti-Semitism has more to do with Britain's "yob culture" of juvenile delinquency than deep-seated bigotry.

There is a self-protective dimension as well: the Jewish community in Britain is well organized through the Community Security Trust to deal effectively with this type of attack, usually associated with far right extremists and young vandals. The Jewish community can also look to active support from the British public and from the police and local authorities in their struggle.

A similar coalition of support and interest has coalesced around the threat from Islamic militants. They target not only Jews, but also Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Western society in general. While Jews are a key focus of their animus since September 11 we can look to the full protection of government and state and even the U.S. superpower in combating the worldwide network of Islamist terrorism.

What then is the new anti-Semitism in Britain? Is it simply a collective psychosis - a hypersensitive minority traumatized by the events of 1933-45 and haunted by fears of genocidal victimization? After all, the contributors to the JPR book appear rational enough to refute this allegation. Most argue that there is indeed a cause producing an effect.

Judeophobia

The irreducible fact is this: something new is at work in Britain. But it's not the old anti-Semitism. It's not eliminationist. It's not genocidal. Nor is it even a deep-seated, visceral hatred of individual Jews.

In fact, the "new anti-Semitism" hasn't shown up yet on the streets in Britain. Instead, it has taken hold in loftier places. For this reason and others the phenomenon in evidence may be more accurately termed Judeophobia - a fear of, and hostility toward Jews as a collectivity, rather than the propagation of the racial ideologies of the old anti-Semitism. Not widespread in "Middle England" at the moment, it nevertheless resides among certain "cognitive elites" within the news media, churches, universities, and trades unions. It is a mindset characterized by an obsession with, and vilification of, the State of Israel, and Jews in general, in the case of Britain, as a consequence of their strong sense of attachment to Israel. Today's Judeophobia is an assault on the essence of the Jewish collectivity, both in terms of a Jewish sovereign state in its ancient homeland, and the nature of robust, emancipated, and self-aware Diaspora communities.

It is important to be clear: Criticism of Israeli policy per se does not constitute Judeophobia. It's not the argument that hurts, it's the way it's conducted. Like the fashionable trend of critics to equate Israel to Nazi Germany. Such language has become routine in school yards and student protests. Calling others "Nazis" takes on an edge, especially when directed at those wearing a police uniform. When this happens the term is used as the ultimate insult with little thought to its meaning. But there can be no excuse when this kind of sentiment is allowed to appear in serious broadsheet newspapers such as the Independent and Observer.

Using Holocaust imagery to describe Israeli defense policy only compounds the hurt. It is nothing less than a contemporary variant of Holocaust denial and a vicious and malicious form of group libel.

Then, too there is the singling out of Israel for moral opprobrium because of its alleged culpability for human and civil rights abuses in its conflict with the Palestinians. All the while gross violations of human and civil rights elsewhere, particularly among its Arab enemies, frequently go ignored and unreported.

The discriminatory outcome of this campaign of vilification is the demonization of Israel, and by association Jews wherever they may live. Such demonization contributes little to constructive dialogue over Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. In fact, it is another obstacle on the road to peace.

This new Judeophobia comfortably co-habits with the use of disparaging stereotypes about Jews that are a throw-back to the old anti-Semitism. Last year, when the New Statesman - the weekly publication for the liberal-left intelligentsia - slapped a piece of incendiary classic anti-Semitic iconography on its front cover - a gold star of David stabbing a supine Union Jack - the classic canard of divided Jewish loyalty was effectively conjured up. The identical conspiracy typology was evoked more recently by Tam Dalyell - Britain's veteran Labour party parliamentarian and a far leftist of aristocratic origin - in his recent allegation of a cabal of Jews in Britain and the United States using their influence to promote a Zionist agenda.

To be sure: the new Judeophobia is less dangerous to individual Jews in Britain than the old anti-Semitism. It does not aim to reproduce Vichy France in 1941, or Vienna in 1938. No one wants to make Jews scrub the streets, or be expelled from universities or occupations, any more than they wish "to relocate the Jews in the East." It is not the Gobineau or Wilhelm Marre type of anti-Jewish prejudice.

Judeophobia in contemporary Britain is also not an organized conspiracy. It does constitute, however, an opportunistic coalition of interest for the new left, the far right and radical Islamists. It includes human rights campaigners and activists, who, while perhaps more well-meaning than others, in their singular obsession contribute to Israel's demonization, and by extension, to all Jews. Israel is now the new cause celebre for the liberal left intelligentsia, educated in the days of student action, anti-Vietnam war protest, the anti-apartheid movement, and the polarized politics of the Cold War. Many of this 1968 generation now occupy senior positions in the universities, media and established churches. For them, Israel represents an outpost of what they most abhor about liberal western democracy.

Back in the ghetto

In retrospect, this new metamorphosis of Judeophobia was predictable as soon as Jews asserted themselves as equals in Western societies or alternatively on the international stage as a nation state. As the perceived - and in most cases, loyal - supporters of the State of Israel, Diaspora Jewish communities inevitably have become the target of anger and hostility, catalyzed by world events. Few would have predicted, however, that in this toxic mix, it is the progressives who appear so keen to put the Jews back where they belong - in the ghetto.

The advantage of hindsight is that it makes even the surprising look predictable. Thus it becomes clear that the current animus is rooted in Soviet-style anti-Zionist doctrine that provided the ideological foundation for the British left. It has a clear Marxist provenance which rejects the notion of Jews a nation and sees them only as a class. Their nationalism is therefore illegitimate. In Stalin's "classless" Soviet Union, any form of alternative religious authenticity was likewise taboo. Its ultimate goal is not biological, but cultural and political.

But Judeophobia in Britain is not just a local problem. It has a knock-on effect on Israelis - not only because the UK is an important ally of the United States. Britain is also the historic cultural and media capital of the wider English-speaking world. How Israeli commentators and spokesmen frame the conflict needs to be approached with care.

Unfortunately, the language used by the far right and far left in Israel does a disservice to the country and erodes the standing of Jews worldwide. Israelis who use the term anti-Semitism indiscriminately and carelessly label virtually every opponent as an anti-Semite actually assist the real anti-Semites. Thus the insidious paradox: When anti-Semitism is everything and everywhere, it's easily dismissed as nothing and nowhere. Israelis who denounce the IDF at pro-Palestine rallies and in the European media give aid and comfort to Islamist militants and those who organize economic and academic boycotts of Israel and by extension Jews everywhere. Stuck in a 1930s time warp, their sin is to be in denial. Unless their Arab and radical European friends actually don a brown shirt, swastika armband and jackboots they refuse to recognize that they have an animus towards the Jewish people.

The Jewish people today face a worldwide political and intellectual assault from Judeophobia. Winning the battle of ideas requires political acumen and finesse. Only a sober analysis and respectful discourse will win the hearts and minds of Jews - and most neutrals.

Peace can't be bought on the layaway plan
"I hope Sharon doesn't evacuate a single outpost. I hope another quarter million Jews settle in the territories." Those aren't the words of a Yesha council member. It was Michael Tarazi, an adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team, who said them.

"I hope Sharon doesn't evacuate a single outpost. I hope another quarter million Jews settle in the territories." Those aren't the words of a Yesha council member. It was Michael Tarazi, an adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team, who said them. He doesn't believe it's possible to reach an agreement any longer on dividing the country along the 1967 lines. If it were up to him, the intifada would have long since been over - and possibly never taken place.

Tarazi proposes to let Israel sow as many settlements as it wants, and wait patiently until the Palestinians and Jews become one entity. He is convinced that in another 10 to 20 years, the world will impose a one person-one vote system on Israel. Then, what happened to the apartheid regime in South Africa will happen to Zionism; a Palestinian will be elected to head the new entity in the 1947 borders.

Tarazi's words should open the eyes of many Israelis given hope by the declarations of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon about the occupation (as important as they were), a Palestinian state and the dismantling of some settlements. Less than three years have passed since an Israeli prime minister offered the Palestinians "the most generous offer they were ever given." All that's left of those offers is Ehud Barak's story that the generous offer was meant only to expose Yasser Arafat's "true face" - and the terrorism and the despair.

It seems the Israelis refuse to miss an opportunity to say the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In another two or three months, two to three years tops, when the Palestinians reject Sharon's "generous offer" for half the West Bank, the prime minister will say he's exposed Abu Mazen's true face. When the road map goes the way of the documents that preceded it and the terror attacks resume, Amos Gilad will say Abu Mazen was nothing more than a clean-shaven version of Arafat.

To avoid the next disappointment, it's recommended to clip and save the following lines, written by Col. (res.) Ephraim Lavie, a former researcher in Military Intelligence, who was adviser on Arab affairs to Barak's "peace administration." Lavie argues that Abu Mazen, like Arafat, and any other Palestinian worthy of the name "leader," is committed to the Palestinian National Council's decision from 1988, which adopted UN Security Council Resolution 242 and seeks a Palestinian state alongside Israel. "The Palestinian concept has been and remains that the negotiations are meant to fulfill its rights, which are derived from what they call `international legitimacy,' and not the result of the asymmetry opposite the Israelis."

Lavie emphasizes that as far as the Palestinians are concerned, "a good offer" can only be one that matches those rights. Therefore, a good offer can only be the rights derived from UN decisions, and readiness to adapt them in light of existing reality, such as border corrections for settlement blocs. And precisely for that reason, they rejected the very idea of a framework agreement because as far as they are concerned, the UN decisions already are a framework. That's also the reason why, during Camp David 2, when Israel offered 26 solutions to the Jerusalem and Temple Mount problem, the Palestinians did not raise any offers.

This confirms Tarazi's message; There is no bargain-basement peace deal. A territorial exchange is the only discount on the withdrawal to the 1967 lines, including East Jerusalem; as far as the Palestinians are concerned, they already gave up 78 percent of the original territory. There's also no "two for one" deal - territories and refugees - for the price of one agreement. The only deal is an agreed solution to the right of return problem that does not upset the demographic balance.

There are also no layaway terms - every day of occupation that goes by only increases the strength of its opponents. That's the way it is: You want, eat - and get two states for two peoples. You don't want, don't eat, and get a clearance sale of Zionism.

Officers who okayed nudity chain gang jailed

Two IDF officers, a man and a woman, were recently sentenced to 14 and 10 days respectively in prison after women soldiers under their command had to remove their clothes during training. In a gym class during a course to train women soldiers as commanders, instructors organized a contest - for women only - in which two teams each had to tie items of clothing together in a set time and the team with the longer line won. The father of one of the girls heard of the contest and complained to a senior officer, who opened an inquiry. The sentenced male officer approved the contest in advance, and the female officer was present during it. (Amos Harel)

Former PM Ehud Barak: Palestinian Authority chairman does not see Israel as Jewish state

Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, in the most fundamental way, did not recognize Israel as a Jewish State, former prime minister Ehud Barak said yesterday at the second conference about the Camp David summit of 2000. Barak devoted much of his two-hour talk to Arafat. He also warned that unless the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians was resolved soon, the Palestinians would try to undermine Israel's existence through a demographic majority that would turn Israel into a binational apartheid country. Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said that the most serious charge against Arafat was not that he rejected Barak's offers at Camp David, but that he refused to discuss the proposals made by then-U.S. president Bill Clinton in December 1999 that went further than those made by Barak in July 2000.

Attorney General pledges tougher stance on sexual harassment in the workplace

Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein has promised to look into ways to heighten employers' awareness of the fact that sexual harassment in the workplace is not just a disciplinary matter but also a criminal offense, and that victims are entitled to take their grievance to the police. Rubinstein was responding to a letter from MK Zahava Gal-On (Meretz), who asked him to issue unequivocal guidelines to institutions and organizations clarifying that internal inquires are insufficient. The law defines clear steps that employers must take to investigate complaints. In his response, Rubinstein stated that internal probes do not bar complainants from filing complaints with the police or suing their assailant for damages. (Gideon Alon)

Police search for soldier missing for 2 weeks

The IDF and police are concerned about a soldier who disappeared from his military base on June 4. According to the soldier's friends, the IDF told the soldier's family that his disappearance would not be publicized to prevent terror organizations from making false statements about a kidnapping. The soldier, Asher Mazagneo, ran away from his base after a confrontation with his commander and fellow soldiers, according to his friends and family. Only on Monday, 10 days after the disappearance and following pressure applied by the organization of Ethiopean Jews in Israel, did the IDF ask the police to publicize his disappearance.

Jerusalem street fair kicks off this evening

Jerusalem's second annual Hutzot Ha'ir fair will open this evening. The fair was initiated last year in an effort to get visitors who were driven away by the frequent terror attacks to return to the capital's downtown area for shopping and entertainment. The fair will run for nine weeks, with each week being devoted to a different theme (food, sport, health, etc.). The "fairgrounds," which will encompass the Ben-Yehuda pedestrian mall and several nearby streets, will be closed off with temporary gates and put under heavy police guard to create a sense of security. Last year, some 500,000 people attended the fair. (Jonathan Lis)

Two British MPs compare Gaza Strip to Warsaw ghetto
By The Associated Press	| Jun. 19, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
LONDON - Two lawmakers who recently returned from Israel compared Palestinian living conditions in the Gaza Strip to those of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II.

Legislator Oona King of the governing Labor Party said Thursday that the Gaza conditions are "the same in nature but not extent" as the notorious walled ghetto in Poland's capital, where Jews were corralled and oppressed by Adolf Hitler's Nazis.

"No government should be behaving like that - least of all a Jewish government," said King, who represents the east London district of Bethnal Green and Bow and is herself Jewish.

King, who traveled to Israel with Jenny Tonge of the Liberal Democrat party, stressed the "very, very big difference" between Gaza and the Warsaw ghetto is that "Palestinians are not being rounded up and put in gas chambers.

"What makes it similar is what happened to the Jewish people in that time which was the seizing of land, being forced from property, torture and bureaucracy - control used in a demeaning way over the smallest task," she told a news conference.

"On top of that building a wall around them, and that is precisely what the Israeli government is doing," King said. "In doing so it is building a political ghetto. I don't think it can escape that conclusion."

Tonge said Palestinians in Gaza could get in or out without scrutiny and "they can't work, they can't sell anything. There is this gradual squeeze."

"I feel it was an apartheid system and it is certainly getting worse - the area where the Palestinians live is getting smaller," she said.

During their visit, King and Tonge said they were caught up in the aftermath of an Israeli assassination attack on a leading Palestinian militant. A building they had been in minutes earlier was attacked by retaliating Palestinians.

The women said they had also been confronted by an Israeli soldier wielding a grenade as they tried to leave the Gaza Strip.

King, who is a member of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality, said she recognized "the terror many Israelis live with as a matter of their daily lives.

"I was more surprised perhaps by the everyday terror that Palestinians live, the detail and nature of which I had not understood," she said.

"We must support the moderate voices as opposed to strengthening extremists."

Officials at the Israeli Embassy in London declined to comment on the legislators' claims, which they made shortly before Prime Minister Tony Blair held previously scheduled talks with Israeli Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"Such views only encourage extremist elements to become involved in terror against Israel, as we recently faced in the suicide bomb in Tel Aviv," she said.

British MPs criticized for comparing Gaza to Warsaw Ghetto
By DPA	| Jun. 23, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Israel's Holocaust memorial council has accused two British MPs of malicious distortion of history for comparing conditions endured by a million Palestinians trapped in Gaza to the Warsaw Ghetto under Nazi occupation, the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.

The Yad Vashem council has written to Oona King, who is Jewish and the Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, and Jenny Tonge, the opposition Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, both in London, who said they were shocked by what they saw during a visit to Gaza earlier this month.

King wrote a commentary nearly a fortnight ago in the London-based Guardian newspaper drawing the analogy with the Warsaw Ghetto to which Jews were confined by the Germans.

"The original founders of the Jewish state could surely not imagine the irony facing Israel today: in escaping the ashes of the Holocaust, they have incarcerated another people in a hell similar in its nature - though not its extent - to the Warsaw Ghetto," she wrote.

Tonge compared the situation in Gaza to apartheid.

The Yad Vashem chairman, Avner Shalev, sent a letter to the pair Sunday saying he was saddened and concerned that "respected members of the British parliament chose to compare events in the Holocaust to a long and complex conflict between two nations".

"Whereas it is legitimate to disagree with Israeli policies and actions, it is grossly illegitimate and malicious to compare them to the most evil and massive crime in modern history in order to heighten the disagreement," he wrote.

"Your statements completely distort historical facts and context. The Nazis' world-view claimed that the Jews were the source of all evil and called for a radical solution to the so-called 'Jewish problem'. In the case of Israel and Palestine, it is a matter of conflicting claims over territorial sovereignty that has deteriorated into a longstanding conflict. Neither side aims to annihilate the other."

Shalev invited the two MPs to visit Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to learn "the facts as we have learned them from documentary evidence".

King stressed in her Guardian article that there is a "very, very big difference" between Gaza and the Warsaw Ghetto because Palestinians are not being murdered in gas chambers.

King stood by her views on Sunday. She said: "I have visited Yad Vashem and was profoundly moved by the experience. That's why it distresses me all the more that some of the policies used to control the Jewish population are similar in nature to the policies used to date to control the Palestinian population. Anyone who denies that is not addressing the facts honestly."

Shalev wrote the pair a letter on Sunday saying "whereas it is legitimate to disagree with Israeli policies and actions, it is grossly illegitimate and malicious to compare them to the most evil and massive crime in modern history in order to heighten the disagreement.

Betting the house with us in it

Treasury policies under the leadership of Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu are a riddle that no one can seem to solve. The economy is in deep recession; citizens struggle daily under economic decrees. It seems none of the cabinet ministers is losing any sleep over the dramatic decline in middle-class living standards, severe cuts in social allowances to those who most need them, and the addition of thousands of people to the ranks of the unemployed.

The finance minister promised us growth from the economic plan. He promised to bring back the foreign investors and promote tourism, if we only clenched our teeth a bit more. Last month, we began to understand what is going to lead us to the longed-for growth. After prolonged lobbying by Mifal Hapayis executives and by private investors - with their own interests - we were told the economic program, which struck down any remnant of social solidarity, would apparently be followed by another economic "stroke of genius." Casinos will be built.

The plan is for five casinos, which its supporters say would increase state revenues from the taxes levied on gambling, would curb illegal gambling, provide jobs for hundreds of people, and boost tourism. A casual observer can only be amazed by the magic solution and ask, "Why didn't we think of it sooner?"

The answer is, we did think of it sooner, even gave it deep thought over 50 years ago, when the state established Mifal Hapayis and after that a council for regulating gambling in sport. The young state, seeking to battle the scourge of illegal gambling, created two institutions to supervise lotteries and sports gambling. The founders of these two bodies clearly meant to channel their revenues into building up the country and developing education, social welfare and sport. The word casino did not enter their minds.

Since then, society has changed in nearly every aspect. As in other countries, individualism has put down roots and some of the value systems we were raised on have been undermined in our own backyard. Now the dog is walking the master - Mifal Hapayis, a government body earning millions of shekels a year now wants to increase profits and is negotiating with the Prime Minister's Office over a casino. The absurdity, or the arrogance, of this seems infinite.

Let us assume that the arguments of those who favor the plan are correct and state revenues will increase. Let us even assume that jobs will be created in peripheral areas, and that criminal activity related to gambling will be reduced, although the experience of the Turks was the exact opposite.

Is the sale of the State of Israel to Lady Luck the treasury's ingenious economic solution. Having damaged every area of our lives, is the treasury now to persecute our souls?

I call on economic advisors, ministry professionals, and anyone with any brains in their heads to stop this deal with the devil, and start to think of more constructive solutions to help the economy. Let us do so before we bring on new troubles - more organized crime, more prostitution, more drug trade avenues, not to mention the gambling addiction that is quietly becoming a national plague.

If this goes ahead, tens of thousands of Israeli households will be ravaged. It will increase the burden on social welfare services and cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of shekels. The mere consideration of legalizing gambling will hamper the police and judicial system in pursuing criminals and grants legitimacy to illegal gambling.

Are we consciously prepared to let those leading the government bet the house, with us inside it? Anyone looking for easy money will pay dearly for it in the long run.

Not a democracy

Regarding "A French Christian state," by Amnon Rubinstein, June 17

The article brings up some interesting problems that, in general, immigrants face as they try to adjust to societies with beliefs different from their own. Although there is some truth to the article, it twists the Muslim view out of proportion completely.

This, however, is not my complaint, as I would expect to see this in any propaganda vehicle. I am writing because I was stunned by the last paragraph, which undoubtedly was the purpose of the article, in which Rubinstein wonders why the same people who see France as a democracy see a contradiction with the words "Jewish" and "democratic."

I believe I can clear this up. It's not a case of the words "Jewish" and "democratic," but "Israel" and "democratic." A quick perusal of some news stories from the same day this editorial appeared can easily explain this.

Take, for example, Gideon Alon's story which reported that Palestinians marrying Israeli citizens would be denied citizenship. Legislation such as this is reminiscent of South African apartheid or the Indian caste system, where one is judged based on what, not who he is.

In France, Mr. Rubenstein presents a situation where a certain group of people demand special treatment, so it is perhaps understandable how controversy could arise. But denying citizenship to the spouse of an Israeli citizen based only on the spouse's heritage is a completely different issue, and is certainly not democratic, nor fair to those citizens who wish to marry Palestinians.

Although I may know the general feelings of Muslims in France, I cannot say that I know what each one feels. In the same manner, although there are Palestinians intent on the destruction of the Israeli state, not all feel that way. So why would Israel pass such a general law?

America, my country, is far from a perfect democracy, although I would be hard-pressed to find a better one. But during the cold war, we did not prevent Russians who wed Americans from becoming citizens, even though we had been taught since infancy that the Russians were intent on our destruction.

These individuals may have been subject to scrutiny or, in extreme cases surveillance, but they were never denied citizenship. Again, not a perfect democracy, but a pretty good one.

Those who link the words "Jewish" and "Israel" will definitely see a contradiction when using the word "democratic." Israel is not a democracy, and it never will be until it treats all people of the world equally.

Get back to teaching

Regarding "Not making the grade," by Relly Sa'ar, June 16

The disgraceful results in math and comprehension recently reported should come as no surprise to anyone. An enormous amount has been written about the effect of budget cuts and pedagogical methods. I would suggest that the subject of school discipline is in sober fact at the root of the educational crisis.

Everyone knows that teachers today have no disciplinary power, and that they are at the mercy of rowdy and often violent pupils - and their parents. Pupils who can and wish to learn in many cases cannot because of constant disruptions in class, which the teachers are powerless to prevent.

The very concept of discipline and punishment in schools has become taboo. Teachers are no longer the object of respect. It is well known that in countries in which strict discipline is enforced, such as Russia, Japan, Singapore for example, their results are much better than ours.

The well-meaning attempts by the liberal psychology school of thought to "understand" every pupil instead of laying down the rules, has lead to a generation of children leaving school ignorant.

I would also add that schools should return to their role of teaching and leave personality development and "finding yourself" to the family.

Playing with cease-fire
The cease-fire is playing with fire. In order to limit the danger that it will lead to a third intifada, worse than its predecessors, all the sides involved must stay within the bounds of the current game - stopping the violence and incitement on one side, and stopping construction of Jewish settlements and the separation fence on the other.

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has nothing to lose from the cease-fire. If all is smooth sailing it will prove that his demand to replace the Palestinian leadership was correct. If it runs aground, it will prove that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is still at the helm.

If the shooting stops, personal security will improve and the economy will recover. If the shooting continues, the public will realize that there is no one to talk to and will accept more economic decrees submissively.

In either case, the expansion of Jewish settlements in the territories and more work on the separation fence will determine the borders of the Palestinian Bantustan, Sharon's revised version of apartheid South Africa's puppet states.

Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, on the other hand, has quite a lot to lose from the cease-fire, either from its success or its failure. Key Fatah activists are saying they are giving him and the hated Muhammad Dahlan, his security chief, a long rope.

If the cease-fire fails, they will hang the rope from the Israeli partners and slip the noose around the necks of those who led others astray. And if the weapons are collected, the wanted men are arrested and the violence wanes, Abbas and Dahlan will be required to supply the merchandise - the end of closures and of assassinations are nothing but packaging. The real merchandise is a Palestinian state within 1967 borders, with exchanges of territories, and Jerusalem as its capital.

However, when U.S. President George Bush wondered in Aqaba how essential is Netzarim, Sharon pretended not to hear. As far as he is concerned, evacuating settlements, if ever, is an issue for 10 years time, if not more. The times are long gone by when the Israeli public, including many who defined themselves as "leftists" less than three years ago, believed that peace is the key to security.

Since the outbreak of the intifada in September, 2000, and even more so since the terror attacks of September, 2001, the assumption that security - "the fight against terror" - is the key to peace has become firmly rooted.

Thus the old equation of "territories in return for peace" has slipped out of fashion. If the occupied territories are supposed to be handed over in exchange for peace, and if peace will be achieved only after security is achieved, then at this stage there is no point in talking about territories.

Over half a year ago the members of the quartet reached the conclusion that shortcuts to a permanent status agreement could lead to a dead end. Their road map, and the brand-new security arrangements engendered by it, succeeded in taking off, for the moment, from the place were previous initiatives were grounded because it was a runway and not a destination.

In order for the Clinton formula, the Nusseibeh-Ayalon understandings or the Beilin-Abed Rabbo document to become papers of any value, a revolution of consciousness and politics will have to happen in Israel. This will be possible only after there is a separation of forces and relative calm.

The life expectancy of the hudna (tactical cease-fire) now looks longer, because for the first time a number of circles of influence have been closed.

The international circle of mainly the United States and the European Union has narrowed down the possibility of the hostile sides maneuvering between the two.

The adoption of the Saudi plan by the Arab League more than a year ago closed the regional circle and paved the way to a certain amount of Syrian pressure on the Hamas and the rejectionist organizations.

Internal Palestinian circles closed around Arafat when 13 top members of the Fatah decided the time had come to push aside the reason, or the excuse, for the humanitarian, political and economic disaster in the territories.

The appointment of Abbas as prime minister proved the major importance of the fourth circle - the government of Israel. Abbas would not have gone far without Sharon's blessing. It is possible the prime minister gambled on Arafat sabotaging Abbas and getting the road map out of his way. However, after the president of the United States embraced the new prime minister and the map, it is difficult to stop the snowball and go back to the familiar and dangerous game of throwing it at the rival's door.

The cease-fire is playing with fire. In order to limit the danger that it will lead to a third intifada, worse than its predecessors, all the sides involved must stay within the bounds of the current game - stopping the violence and incitement on one side, and stopping construction of Jewish settlements and the separation fence on the other.

Return to South Africa - 15 years down the line
My family and I left South Africa on aliyah at the end of 1987. I have not been back since, until this month, when a last-minute family event brought Marlyn and me back to S.A. for a short, hectic, wonderful visit, 15 years after leaving. It was a strange experience; everything was the same, yet nothing was.

My family and I left South Africa on aliyah at the end of 1987. I have not been back since, until this month, when a last-minute family event brought Marlyn and me back to S.A. for a short, hectic, wonderful visit, 15 years after leaving.

It was with mild trepidation that I boarded the El Al flight for Johannesburg. What would I find on the other end? How would I feel about visiting my old haunts, seeing old friends and family, left so long ago. How would I feel about the "new" South Africa with all its promise and problems.

In a sense, this trip was about closing circles. In Durban, it was visiting my parents' graves in the Redhill Cemetery, walking across trimmed lawns to pay homage to friends who had passed away long before their time, visiting my niece's tombstone at Stellawood - she was less than a year old when she died of typhoid in 1986. It was also about renewing acquaintances with old friends, finding that in 15 years nothing had really changed between us, and meeting new family members.

We started our 13-day whirlwind trip in Johannesburg, now almost unrecognizable since I lived and worked there 30 years ago. The international airport is magnificent; the customs and passport officials, all black, are friendly, courteous and helpful.

The place is buzzing. Thousands of international visitors, business people and tourists, arriving every day. Flights from all over the world pull up to the terminal every hour. Foreign languages are everywhere, foreign currency flows. But the rand still languishes around 8 to the dollar, 13 to the pound. Although prices in South African terms are high, when local prices are converted to dollars, you can hardly believe your luck - a succulent steak for R75 ($9); a luxurious villa with all the trimmings, garden, swimming pool, electrified fence and so on, for only R1 million (the $120, 000 that would buy a two-room apartment in Holon).

Nicely pricey

But when you're earning in rands everyday things are pricey. I was told that until recently a reasonably "good" salary on which a family could afford some of the good things in life, including live-in servants, netted out at about R14,000 a month. Today, a family needs two salaries to live at the same standard. But, and it's a huge "but" for former South Africans in Israel, you can buy a house - even in the million-rand bracket - with just a 10-percent deposit. Everybody drives leased cars - Mercedes, BMWs, a wide range of SUVs, and there are generally two vehicles in the driveway, if they haven't been stolen in the last 24 hours.

Johannesburg is still the big, raucous, brash and fast-moving city it always was, except now the city stretches from Vereeniging in the south, with Midrand joining Johannesburg to Pretoria in the north. The East and West Rand are contiguous to Johannesburg and there is hardly any space between any of these areas. It's megalopolis. Highways are plentiful, broad and fast moving, except in rush hour when they grind to a halt as in any big world city.

We didn't go into the center of Johannesburg - we had been warned - but we did manage to get a glimpse of the CBD from the M1 Highway which skirts the eastern side of the city. It looked pretty much the same, except for a huge building or two and the new Nelson Mandela Bridge which replaced the old Queen Elizabeth Bridge linking the city to Braamfontein.

Social harmony

In fact, this seemed to be our recurring impression of the new South Africa. Everywhere we went, and Durban most of all, seemed so familiar and yet so strange. It was the closest I have felt to being in a time warp, as if I had fallen asleep one night like Rip van Winkel and woken 15 years later. Everything was the same yet nothing was.

Socially the new South Africa is fantastic. The interaction between black and white, among people of the rainbow nation, is quite remarkable. From what we could see in the malls, restaurants, coffee shops, department stores - Woolworths still rules - people are relaxed, totally at ease.

But this is superficial, seeing as a foreigner, even if one had lived there in the dark days of apartheid. The country still has a long way to go. There are enormous challenges. There is unemployment, mainly among whites facing the competition of "affirmative action" in the workplace.

As one young cousin, a highly qualified stockbroker who had worked on the JSE for seven years and now cannot find a place in his profession, quipped: "If you're white, male and qualified, forget it; there are no jobs available." He and his young wife are seriously considering leaving for England.

There is still black poverty - a lot of it. We saw shanty towns on the outskirts of Johannesburg and Cape Town every bit as grim as they were in the "old days," but Alexandra and Soweto have running water and electricity.

Corruption is said to be rife and AIDS is decimating the black population, causing one of the serious problems - AIDS orphans left to their own devices, without a home, money or job prospects. They roam the streets of downtown Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, forming the core of a huge social problem the government is reacting to extremely slowly.

Crime is a widespread epidemic. There is scarcely one person we know who hasn't been a victim. My sister in Johannesburg had her car stolen, was mugged, lost all her jewelry, and had her house broken into, despite an arsenal of burglar alarms and a huge German shepherd. All this happened in a period of 3 months.

Defensive shields

Every individual house, gorgeous and luxurious as it may be, is surrounded by a massive wall, topped by electronic trip wires and alarms. Security company shields adorn every gate. When entering a driveway, you stop to check if anybody is approaching from any distance before opening the gate. A good friend of ours in Durban had a gun thrust in his neck as he was getting out of his car in his garage. Now he has full length mirrors on the garage wall and doesn't leave his car until the garage door is closed.

As an Israeli, there is a darker side to South Africa, which is more than disturbing, it is downright scary. It was seen in the World Anti-Racism Conference last year and is clear in the outright anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli attitudes of a large part of the population.

It is fanned by the incitement of the Mullahs and leaders of the huge Muslim communities, especially in the Cape. It is abetted by the fawning self-hatred of a small number of the South African Jewish community themselves.

There were questions about the wall being built between Israel and the Palestinian areas. Why? It's not fair, what do we hope to achieve? The poor Palestinians. This comes from people who live in designer prisons, behind high walls, with electronic anti-intrusion devices, barbed wire, vicious guard dogs, and rapid response systems, all aimed at keeping out those who want to share their wealth. The irony was lost on them.

There are other attitudes, more militant and right-wing than any West Bank settler - "I don't understand your prime minister. Why doesn't he just go in and finish the job?

The final leg of our rush through South Africa was Cape Town, and we had forgotten just what a gorgeous city it is. However, it wasn't the drive down to Cape Point, or out to the Spier Wine Estate in Stellenbosch, or even the magnificent Waterfront shopping and entertainment complex that topped our Cape Town trip. It was a short voyage across 11 kilometers of Table Bay to Robben Island that will be a lasting memory.

We had a choice, being in Cape Town only for two and a half days, of going up Table Mountain or out to Robben Island. As a returning South African for whom Robben Island was the most sinister symbol of apartheid South Africa, there was no choice. I had to close this final gap.

Served with pride

Arriving at Robben Island dockside, one is greeted with huge enlarged photographs of early prisoners arriving on the same dockside. And then you walk toward the prison enclosure itself. The gateway, bearing its decades old engraved message, "Welcome to Robben Island - Welkom in Robbeneiland," and the boastful prison service motto, "We serve with Pride - Ons Dien met Trots," is alarmingly resonant to any Jew. People were incarcerated here because they dared to think differently, to be different, to be racially different from the rulers who believed they were the pinnacle of mankind.

The tour guides on Robben Island are former black prisoners and former white guards and this more than anything shows just how far the new South Africa has come from its dismal past. They live and work side by side now, no one better or worse than the other, no one controlling or being submissive to the other.

It was strange to hear the tour guide telling a group made up largely of foreigners, the stories of the prisoners on Robben Island - Mandela, Sobukwe, Sisulu, names which I as a young journalist on a Johannesburg Sunday newspaper those long years ago, knew so well.

It was surreal to hear the tour guide talking about those whites who fought the good fight for justice in the old South Africa - Helen Suzman, Benjamin Pogrund, people I had met, interviewed, written about and frankly hero-worshipped in my days in the newsroom, covering social and political events.

And frankly, I felt a swelling of pride that I had been involved, albeit in the most minute of ways, vicariously, in the struggle which has given birth to the brave new South Africa. Our trip to the Cape ended too quickly and it was back to Johannesburg for one night.

We went to the airport early Monday morning, boarded El Al 767, and within nine hours were back on our own brave new world beyond the gates of Ben Gurion Airport.

We had been away exactly 13 days, met 86 family members and friends, spent two days viewing game in the Pilansberg, traveled across South Africa from Johannesburg to Durban to Cape Town and back, and now we were back in the sweltering mid-summer Tel Aviv heat. We had settled a lot of unfinished business. We had seen the new South Africa and we had loved every minute of it, but now - we were home.

Government slammed as `racist' for bill to prevent Arab family unification
By Gideon Alon	| Jul. 15, 2003 | 12:00 AM

"Since 1994, some 140,000 Arab residents of the territories have received Israeli citizenship and have settled in the country," Deputy Attorney General Meni Mazuz told the Knesset Interior and Environment Committee yesterday. Mazuz's comments came during a discussion on a government-sponsored bill to almost completely prevent residents of the territories from receiving Israeli citizenship or residency status by virtue of family unification under the Entrance into Israel Law.

During the stormy discussion, Mazuz said the government believed that the proposed law was in the country's national interests, in light of the fact that requests for family unification had increased markedly in the past decade.

Representatives of the Arab parties harshly criticized the proposed law. MK Ahmed Tibi (Hadash) termed it "a purely racist [proposal] directed against the Arab Israeli collective;" while MK Issam Makhoul (Hadash) said the bill was anti-democratic, inhumane and a violation of international conventions.

MK Wasal Taha (Balad) said that preventing individuals from choosing their spouses was reminiscent of the Nuremberg Laws; while MK Abdulmalik Dehamshe (United Arab List) commented that the law would leave the stain of apartheid on the Knesset and state.

Committee chairman MK Yuri Stern (National Union) had a hard time maintaining order during the panel's deliberations, breaking his gavel at one point in the discussion. He said he intended to push the legislative process ahead rapidly, as the government viewed the bill as vital. He said he would try to complete the process by the end of the Knesset's summer sitting on July 30.

Herzl Gadj, the director of the Interior Ministry's Population Registry, said that at present in the Galilee, there were 64,000 people who had come into Israel as Jordanian visitors to the Palestinian Authority. He added that in the period 1999-2002, the Interior Ministry had received 22,000 requests for family unification. Some 16,000 had been approved, he noted.

Mandela celebrates 85th birthday with star-studded banquet
By The Associated Press	| Jul. 19, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
JOHANNESBURG - Hollywood stars, royalty, politicians and even Nelson Mandela's cook and gardener joined him at a banquet Saturday to celebrate his 85th birthday.

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary and their daughter Chelsea were among the 1,600 guests from around the world at the highlight of a series events to honor the former South African president who celebrated his birthday Friday.

Walking up the red carpet to the sounds of a marimba band and an African choir, stars of the stage, screen and the catwalk like Robert De Niro, Naomi Campbell and Oprah Winfrey entered the Sandton Convention Center for what has been described as "the party of the Millennium."

Sporting heroes rubbed shoulders with former political prisoners, musicians and millionaires.

"It was a massive operation," said Professor Jakes Gerwel Chairman of the Nelson Mandela Foundation describing the banquet's planning.

"I'm just waiting for my bear hug," quipped his wife Febe, who said she had not yet had an opportunity to congratulate Mandela on his birthday.

South African President Thabo Mbeki and his wife Zanele arrived shortly before Mandela and his third wife Graca Machel. They celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on Mandela's birthday.

Mandela is respected and admired across the world, to South Africans, who call him by his clan name, Madiba, he is a superstar of near-mythic proportions. He is regarded as a hero who preached racial reconciliation to the apartheid-scarred nation despite the 27 years he spent imprisoned by the white, racist regime

He won the nation's first all-race elections after the fall of apartheid in 1994, retired in 1999. But he is as popular as ever.

The banquet was also attended by former South African President F.W. de Klerk who released Mandela from prison in 1990 and who shared with him the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts at reconciliation.

Earlier Saturday, Mandela attended the funeral of his daughter-in-law Zondi Mandela who died this week from pneumonia. She was the wife of his only remaining son Makgatho born to Mandela and his first wife, Evelyn Ntoko. Their other son, Thembi was killed in a car accident in 1969 while Mandela was in prison

Unable to attend the banquet was Raymond Mhlaba, who was jailed for life with Mandela in 1964. He was in hospital after suffering a mild stroke.

"It's a great pity for him because he really wanted to be at Madiba's side," said family spokesman Vuyo Toto. "These old men have gave come a long way together."

Also at the banquet were South Africans Callie and Monique Strydom who made world headlines when they were held hostage for more than four months in the Phillipines by the Abu Sayyaf a small Muslim extremist group.

"We are honored and privileged to be able to share such a special time with Madiba - there is only one of his kind in the world," said Monique Strydom before the party.

"I'm very excited about being with him on this milestone," said Johannesburg businesswoman Suzanne Weil.

Clinton earlier Saturday praised Mandela as a "gift to humanity" while presenting the inaugural Nelson Mandela Lecture in which he said the world should do more for Africa.

"In my lifetime only two people have made the personal journey as the leaders of their nations in the rough and tumble world of politics, Mahatma Gandhi and his worthy successor, Nelson Mandela," Clinton said to applause.

In his speech he laid out a three-step plan he said Western nations could use to help raise Africa out of poverty. It included relieving foreign debt, increasing trade and helping in wealth creation to "unleash huge amounts of resources" that could be freed for development.

He spoke at length about his family's attachment to Mandela, which began when he and his daughter Chelsea watched an early morning television broadcast of Mandela "walking to his freedom" in 1990.

"I am only his third biggest fan in my family," Clinton said, bringing a wide smile to Mandela's face, who received a hug from Hillary Clinton.

"We can't work for Africa, or against Africa, but must work with Africa," he said.

Wall-eyed
Now Moshav Nir Ziv wants a wall to separate it from the neighboring Arab town of Pardes Snir. `Soon they will turn us into a ghetto,' says one resident of the town
By Aryeh Dayan	Jul. 22, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The 300-meter strip of land between the eastern edge of Moshav Nir Zvi and the western edge of Lod's Pardes Snir neighborhood not only separates two neighboring Israeli communities, but also symbolizes the border between a poor, underprivileged third world and a wealthy, developed first world. The gap between these neighboring communities will become even more tangible if and when Moshav Nir Zvi implements its plan, which has already obtained the backing of the government and Lod Municipality.

The moshav members want to build a four-meter by 1.5-kilometer wall that will totally separate their moshav from the adjacent neighborhood. They would like to build the wall around 20 meters away from the neighborhood's westernmost homes, i.e., around 300-400 meters from the moshav's easternmost homes. Pardes Snir residents will emerge from their homes and face a giant wall encircling their neighborhood from several sides; Moshav Nir Zvi residents will emerge from their beautiful homes and will no longer see the not-so-nice homes of their neighbors.

This is not the only separation wall now under construction in Israel. In addition to the separation fence going up east of the Green Line, a similar wall is also being built between the lovely villas of Caesarea and the homes of the village of Jisr al-Zarqa. Both cases involve a wealthy Jewish population seeking to build a wall to physically separate them from a neighboring and poorer Arab population.

New immigrants from Argentina established Moshav Nir Zvi in 1954 and everything built there was carefully planned. The large homes surrounded by vast lawns, the roads and paths connecting them are paved, signposted, and well maintained. Decorative streetlamps illuminate them at night and tall and stately trees provide shade during the day. The hundreds of families living on the moshav have at their disposal a swimming pool, library and a new community center.

Pardes Snir, which started on agricultural lands that the state handed over to several Arab families in 1951 in exchange for vast properties it appropriated from them in the Poleg river area, was not, in contrast, planned at all nor did it receive any kind of government funding. The result: stores and craft shops are mixed into a densely crowded residential area; the access roads are nothing more than dirt paths, exposed to the sun during the day and completely dark at night. Only around 15 years ago, when the Ganei Aviv neighborhood was being built to its east, Pardes Snir residents could connect their homes, at their own expense, to the new Jewish neighborhood's sewerage system. In Pardes Snir, where thousands of families live, there isn't a single public garden or playground. It does have, however, around 10 drug sales stations (caspomatim - ATMs - in the local lingo) that operate freely and openly.

Heading for boiling point

The tensions created in recent years between Pardes Snir and Moshav Nir Zvi may reach a dangerous boiling point if the separation wall is built. Moshav members say the need to build the wall is due to the moshav's constant exposure to unending provocations from and burglaries by Pardes Snir residents. The drug sales points draw drug dealers and addicts from all over the country to the neighborhood. On the way there, they pass through the moshav and occasionally break into some of the homes there.

"There's no law or enforcement there," complains Arye Efrat, one of the founders of Nir Zvi and currently the deputy chair of the Emek Lod regional council. "They sell drugs in caspomatim there and there is haphazard construction, which also eats away at our land. We came to Nir Zvi to find a quiet corner and day and night, they're getting on our nerves."

"The proximity to Pardes Snir," adds Colonel (res.) Amir Sheleg, the leader of the campaign to build the wall, "has become a nuisance that affects our standard of living. Gangs of drug dealers are fighting for control there. They shoot at each other and the bullets graze our homes. We are also exposed to the intense hatred of us as well as unending vandalism. We had to get rid of our orchard industry because of the thefts they perpetrated and the damages incurred."

Sheleg says he "like many others in Nir Zvi," takes a moderate political stance "and I even voted for Meretz." He says he would also be willing to agree with those Pardes Snir residents who claim that the crime and violence there are an inevitable result of the ongoing discrimination and deprivation. "But," he says, "I don't understand why I have to pay the price of this policy of discrimination."

The request to build the wall was first put forward in 1999, when the government of Benjamin Netanyahu launched a program to revive Lod. According to the plan drawn up at that time, the planning authorities were to approve the illegal construction in Pardes Snir, the municipality was to invest in building infrastructure and the government was to have finance paving a wide two-way road encircling the neighborhood. However, Moshav Nir Zvi, on whose lands a part of this road would have been paved, made its agreement to the plan contingent on construction of the wall.

The plan was frozen because the municipality refused to take upon itself funding the construction of the wall. The plan was revived around a year ago when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon sought to move ahead with reviving the city of Lod. Moshav Nir Zvi members again gave their consent to the plan contingent on construction of the wall and Sharon, who accepted their terms, found a way to deal with the issue of funding: in July 2002 he submitted a draft proposal stipulating that construction of the wall would be financed by the finance and transportation ministries to the government for approval.

The cabinet ministers realized incidentally, that they could not call a spade a spade: the decision they voted on did not refer to a separation wall, but to an "acoustic wall" that would protect Moshav Nir Zvi residents from the noise from the new road. In the detailed plan for the wall submitted by the Lod municipality to the local planning committee, the term "acoustic wall" is not mentioned.

Unreasonable to the extreme

Some two weeks ago, following the submission of the plan to the planning committee, the Pardes Snir residents' committee appealed to the High Court of Justice against the decision to build the wall. "The government's decision is unreasonable to an extreme degree and leads to an unreasonable and unfair result," wrote Attorney Hisham Shabaita, of the Human Rights program at the Tel Aviv University faculty of law, who represents the residents' committee. His central argument is that the government, under guise of building an acoustic wall, has in effect decided to finance the construction of the wall whose sole purpose is to divide population segments "against a national and class-related backdrop."

Shabaita is planning to oppose the wall in the planning committees as well. "The decision is being presented as a planning one, but in effect it's a serious political and social decision," says Nili Baruch, an urban planner active in Bamakom, an organization that defends human rights in the planning sphere and which is help attorney Shabaita in the preparation of his planning objections.

"This wall is not coming to solve acoustic problems that nobody has bothered to check even exist, but to separate between stronger and weaker populations and further compartmentalize the weaker segment." Such walls, says Baruch, were built in South African cities during the apartheid era and between Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods of Belfast. "In all cases," she adds, "the walls only increased the tension between the groups."

The plan to build the wall has already stirred emotions in Pardes Snir and prompted residents to refer to their neighbors in Nir Zvi as "snobs" and "racists." "I have no doubt that Nir Zvi is suffering to a certain degree from the situation in our neighborhood," says Araf Muharab, a neighborhood resident and Lod city council member, who is among the petitioners against the wall, "but we are suffering a lot more than they are. Instead of understanding that we are the main victims of the drug dealing that goes on here, they are making us out to be the ones responsible for it."

"The thieves who break into homes in Moshav Nir Zvi don't come from our neighborhood," says Ali Abu-Katafan, a former drug addict who lives in Pardes Snir and makes a living mending window shutters in the area. "The ones breaking into their homes are Jewish drug dealers who come here from all over the Dan region. And they only come here because the police prefer that all drug dealing be concentrated here, in the Arab neighborhoods of Lod, instead of being spread out in Rishon Letzion, Rehovot, Nes Tziona and other Jewish cities."

"The drug phenomenon here is unmatched anywhere else in the country," adds Muharab. "Every day, in broad daylight within sight of the police, 12,000 hits of drugs are sold to people who come here from all over the country in thousands of taxis. There are 50 drug dealers here, but there are no more than 50 addicts here. The drug problem in the neighborhood is not a result of internal social decline. I have no doubt that there are more youths who are drug users in Nir Zvi than there are here. Nir Zvi members portray the neighborhood as if it were the Wild West. We're not the Wild West, but a neighborhood suffering from ongoing discrimination and distress and where most of the residents are decent people who work very hard to earn a living despite the drug dealers surrounding them."

Muharab sees the move to build a wall as another expression of a broader process, which "if not halted, will transform Israel into a country of one wall after another. Those members of Nir Zvi who want to build the wall want in effect to totally separate themselves from the Arabs," he says. "They don't want to see us and they think if they build a wall they really will stop seeing us." That, in his opinion, "is a very dangerous process" because "after Nir Zvi, the residents of Ganei Aviv will ask to build a separating wall and then we'll find ourselves surrounded by walls on all sides."

This process is dangerous, he warns, "because the wall will also choke the neighborhood and turn it into a ghetto. It will create a destructive psychological effect among the residents because it will make it clear that they are unwanted, that they are in jail."

Muharab believes that not all Nir Zvi residents are in favor of building the wall. According to him, its proponents are mainly "a large group of nouveau riche Tel Avivians who joined the moshav in the last few years and for whom the wall is a means of raising the value of their property. Their motive is class-related and a matter of real estate, but the means they are using to achieve it is racist. They have to realize that the end cannot justify all the means."

How low can the Knesset go?
One might think that the Knesset could not go any lower, but since it began its activities in February of this year, the current Knesset has managed to break all records for shame and disgrace.
By Gideon Alon	| Jul. 30, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Last Wednesday, less than one day after Professor Asa Kasher and retired Judge Professor Yitzhak Zamir leveled very harsh criticism at the behavior of Knesset members, reminding them during a study day on ethics that they serve as public role models, Minister Meir Sheetrit fell upon the chair of the Labor Knesset faction MK Dalia Itzik from the speaker's podium, saying, "I will shut you up! What do you think? I will shut your big mouth up!"

Former minister Itzik rejoined with, "You shut your mouth, idiot! The person who can shut my mouth has not yet been born and you will not be the first."

A short while later, MK Nissim Ze'ev of Shas upbraided Interior Minister Avraham Poraz in the Knesset plenum, saying that Poraz's assistant was a "homosexual who disgusted anyone that came near him," and that therefore, according to halakha [Jewish law], he was "worse than an animal."

A few weeks earlier, MK Roni Bar-On (Likud) told his fellow faction member Gila Gamliel, "If I had a daughter like you, I would kill my wife."

These three strident chords are largely typical of the 16th Knesset. One might think that the Knesset could not go any lower, but since it began its activities in February of this year, the current Knesset has managed to break all records for shame and disgrace.

For some time now, the police's national fraud squad has been questioning four MKs under warning for falsifying a vote during the passage of the new economic plan. The four - Michael Gorlovsky, Yaakov Edri and Yehiel Hazan of the Likud and Wasal Taha of Balad - denied the accusations (with the exception of Gorlovsky, who admitted voting twice and was subsequently penalized by the Knesset Ethics Committee). Minister Avraham Poraz (Shinui) was also interrogated on this matter, but all agree he had voted twice unintentionally.

The double voting affair, which Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein called "a serious phenomenon touching on the very foundations of democracy," is also without precedent. There have already been cases of ministers and Knesset members being convicted of crimes and even sentenced to jail sentences, but never has an attempt to influence the outcome of a vote in the Knesset plenum by falsifying a vote come to light before. Never have Knesset members been suspected of fraud, forgery and breach of trust committed within the walls of the legislature itself.

No immunity reform

Also troubling was the decision by the Knesset House Committee in May to reject a request by the attorney general to lift the immunity of MK Naomi Blumental (Likud) so that she could be indicted for corruption and election bribery. The committee decided by one vote (eight to seven) not to remove her immunity for her role in an affair that involved her paying for the accommodations of Likud Central Committee members at the City Tower Hotel in Tel Aviv. Knesset representatives, including MK Gorlovsky, together with Shas, United Torah Judaism and the National Union said no to Rubinstein.

Since then, considerable effort has been made to carry out a reform in the procedure involved in the lifting of immunity. Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin blew the dust off the Nissim Committee Report - a public committee headed by former justice minister Moshe Nissim - that in 1997 recommended transferring the authority for the decision on whether or not to remove a Knesset member's immunity to an external body, and convened a debate in his chambers together with the members of that committee (Moshe Nissim, Professor Claude Klein, Professor Eliezer Lederman and attorney Uriel Linn) and Dr. Susie Navot, who is writing a doctorate on the subject of immunity for Knesset members. Afterward, the Knesset House Committee held three meetings on the subject of immunity, and it was decided to oppose transferring the authority on the matter of revoking immunity to an external body. The main argument of those opposing the proposal was that such a far-reaching step would further erode the status of the Knesset and undermine its authority. Last week, coalition chair MK Gideon Sa'ar, who supports the implementation of the recommendations, once again tried to pass a bill in this reform spirit in the Knesset plenum, but was unsuccessful.

Even less far-reaching bills promoted by MKs Michael Eitan and Roni Bar-On on the subject of immunity have been removed from the agenda. Eitan proposed that the attorney general's request to lift immunity be automatically accepted, unless the suspected Knesset member asks the Knesset House Committee to debate non-revocation. Bar-On proposed that a decision by the House Committee should serve only as a recommendation to the plenum, which would ultimately decide on the matter in an open vote.

In the current term, the dispute between the Knesset and the Supreme Court over the authority of the court to annul laws passed by the Knesset that run counter to Basic Laws heated up. The tension between the two branches of government peaked in March, when new Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin let loose a harsh attack on the Supreme Court and the "constitutional revolution" led by the President of the Supreme Court, Justice Aharon Barak. Rivlin inveighed against the fact that a Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court judge saw fit to annul a law passed by the Knesset with the claim that it ran counter to a Basic Law. Rivlin argued that judicial activism would "destroy the trust of the public in the Knesset, a trust without which it has no raison d'etre."

Rivlin's critique did not go unanswered. Barak responded in no less a critical vein: "Do not undermine the legitimacy of the court. Criticize its decisions." In his view, Rivlin had undermined the court's very legitimacy, "something unheard of." In the wake of the exchange of blows between the heads of the legislature and the judiciary, a "cease-fire" came into effect during which the Knesset would pass a law that would determine that only the Supreme Court would be entitled to decide by a special majority on the annulment of a law, at which time the Knesset would be given the opportunity to amend the law.

In the area of legislation, the current Knesset has not yet found the time to complete the passage of important laws because only six months have passed since it began its activities. The most prominent law passed thus far is the governmental law on the battle against organized crime, which for the first time determines what organized crime is, makes it possible to impose severe penalties for those heading crime organizations and gives law enforcement authorities the tools to fight against these organizations.

There has not been any real advance in the legislation of Basic Laws. However, in the discussion held in the chambers of the Knesset speaker last month, MK Avraham Ravitz (UTJ) stunned the others present when he withdrew his opposition to the legislation of Basic Law: Legislation, which would determine the normative superiority of Basic Laws over other laws.

At the same time, the chairman of the Knesset Legislative Committee, MK Michael Eitan (Likud), advanced a long list of thorough and in-depth discussion on the subject of a "broad-consensus constitution," but the discussions, some of which were academic, are still far from ripening into legislation. As of now, the Knesset plenum knocked down four Basic Laws: Social Rights bills on preliminary reading.

Crumbling opposition

The broad coalition, which enjoys the support of 68 Knesset members, has yet to encounter a close-knit, fighting opposition. Coalition chair MK Gideon Sa'ar has been steering the coalition effectively, sometimes using an iron fist. When four Likud Knesset members, David Levy, Gila Gamliel, Haim Katz and Marina Solodkin, did not vote in favor of the economic plan, they were given disciplinary penalties. In the coalition, it is still difficult to point to Knesset members whose parliamentary activities are exemplary, with the exception of old-timers Michael Eitan and Avraham Hirschson (as chair of the Knesset Finance Committee). Among the new Knesset members, the most noticeable are Gila Gamliel, as chair of the Committee for the Advancement of the Status of Women, Roni Bar-On, as chair of the Knesset House Committee, former Shin Bet officer Ehud Yatom and the young Gilad Arden. Other promising new MKs appear to be Shinui's Reshef Chayne, Melli Polishuk-Bloch, Ilan Leibowitz and Ehud Ratzabi, National Union's Professor Aryeh Eldad and the NRP's Gila Finkelstein.

By the way, the only Knesset member that has not made a single speech in the Knesset plenum, proposed a single bill or asked a single question is the prime minister's son, MK Omri Sharon. When asked why he has not mounted the Knesset podium in the more than six months since elected, he responded, "When there is an important subject on which I have something to say, I will get up to speak. Meanwhile, I am studying the subjects, participating in the debates in both the plenum and the committees."

In the opposition, Labor faction chair MK Dalia Itzik tried to create a tight bloc that would present a united front in its struggle against the government, but in light of the diametrically opposed views on political and security matters of Shas and the UTJ on the one hand, and Meretz and the Arab parties on the other, it is difficult to conduct a common struggle on anything except social-welfare issues. The no-confidence votes against the government presented almost weekly have become an absurd tool that no one takes seriously.

It is difficult to point to any prominent Knesset members in the opposition, with the exception of a few old timers, such as Dalia Itzik and Avraham Burg (Labor), Zahava Gal-On and Ran Cohen (Meretz), Yitzhak Cohen (Shas), David Tal (One Nation) and Ahmed Tibi (Hadas-Taal). Among the opposition Knesset members of note (so far) are Yitzhak Herzog, Yuli Tamir, Danny Yatom and Orit Noked (Labor) and Yisrael Eichler (UTJ).

The hostility and tension between the Jewish and Arab Knesset members continues to characterize the debates of the current Knesset. The stormy debate over the killing of the Hamas chief in Nablus, Salah Shehadeh, or the comments by Minister Avigdor Leiberman that he is willing to provide the security prisoners with a bus that would take them to the sea are two example of the subject that have kicked up a storm in the Knesset plenum.

In one of the debates about Leiberman's buses, held in June, after Deputy Knesset Speaker Moshe Kahlon removed several Arab Knesset members from the plenum, MK Azmi Beshara (Balad) said, "The Israeli parliament must decide how it wants to be run. It is not doing anyone a favor when it listens to me. I will not regret it very much or be sorry if the Israeli parliament were to decide that it no longer wants Arabs here. Then the whole world would see that that Israel does not want Arabs, and that it is an apartheid state."

PA: `Our successes have turned out to be failures'
By Danny Rubinstein	| Jul. 31, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
"The State of Israel is not serious about implementing the road map," Palestinian Minister of Security Mohammed Dahlan said yesterday in an interview with the Al-Araby TV station, expressing of a growing sense of disappointment in the Palestinian leadership with the outcome of the visit to Washington by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

Similar statements were made yesterday by Palestinian cabinet members Nabil Sha'ath and Nabil Amr. The editorial in the Palestinian weekly, The Jerusalem Times, published tomorrow, says Palestinian Legislative Council members are expressing doubt whether Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas' own visit to Washington was successful, and it is possible that his government will not survive a vote of confidence by the PLC. Such a vote won't come sooner than next week.

Abbas meanwhile wrapped up his foreign travels with stops in Morocco and France. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the PLC, who accompanied Abbas on the trip, is undergoing medical tests in Paris. When he returns to the territories he will prepare for a PLC session.

Palestinian spokesmen have been warning that what had appeared to be successes have turned into failures, and what they are losing are genuine assets. Their demand for a full freeze on the settlements, as stated in the road map, has been shoved aside, and they received the dismantling of a handful of outposts, and the actual number of outposts in the West Bank now is greater than it was at the time of the Aqaba summit, a few weeks ago.

On the prisoner release issue, President George W. Bush has accepted Israel's position that prisoners with "blood on their hands" are not going to be released, and a quarter of those who will be released are petty criminals and Palestinians caught without permits working in Israel.

Two hundred such Palestinians were caught last week in Shuafat.

The checkpoint issue led Al Quds, the West Bank's most widely distributed newspaper, to run a front page headline on Tuesday saying "IDF lifts 3 checkpoints - only 157 to go," which is why Dahlan last night raised the demand in his meeting with Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz that IDF withdrawals from Palestinian towns and cities be accompanied by the dismantling of checkpoints around those towns - otherwise the withdrawals are meaningless.

One of Abbas' confidants laughed yesterday over the headline in the Israeli press that the IDF would be withdrawing from Jericho. Every Palestinian knows Jericho is the only city in the West Bank where the IDF is not located. It has full Palestinian security control, and it has prisoners such as the secretary general of the Popular Front, Ahmed Sa'adat, a wanted man in Israel and in prison, on the basis of an agreement, in the Palestinian prison in Jericho.

The Palestinians believe the tens of millions of dollars they've received so far from Washington are very little compared to what Israel gets - and they have to pay a high price, impossibly high as far as they are concerned, of dismantling the terrorist infrastructure of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. "The hudna could collapse because Israel is violating every agreement," said Hamas and Jihad spokesmen yesterday.

There was particularly vehement criticism of what they regard as Bush's surrender on the separation fence issue. The "Berlin Wall," as Yasser Arafat called it, or "the apartheid separation fence," according to Al-Hayyat Al-Jedida, - "shows that Israel is maintaining the state of war with us," said the newspaper.

And the main point is that according to the data Abbas gave the president, the fence will involve expropriation of 13 percent of the West Bank. Losing tens of thousands of dunam of land is so far, for the Palestinians, the only tangible result of a political process that hasn't even really begun yet.

Nonviolence. Why didn't we think of that before?
Voices in the territories are calling for a switch to nonviolent struggle. In the Palestinian press, writers speak of the power of the weak.

The most famous statement made by Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) before he was appointed to this position was that the Palestinians need to end the "military intifada."

He wrote and spoke about this often, explaining that Palestinian groups that use guns, explosives and suicide attacks do huge political damage to the Palestinian cause. "We must conduct the struggle and the intifada without violence," he said.

The idea is not new. Years ago, there were Palestinians who recommended adopting the nonviolence used by Mahatma Gandhi against British rule in India and by Martin Luther King, Jr. in his fight for civil rights for blacks in the U.S. The most prominent Palestinian proponent of this idea was a young man named Mubarak Awad, who had been educated in America. About 10 years ago, Awad tried to interest the Palestinian public in the West Bank and Gaza with this idea. But the Israeli Interior Ministry deported him and he returned to the U.S.

Today as well, more than a few Palestinians are caught up in promoting nonviolent struggle. In general, they are part of a not particularly large circle of academics who understand the power inherent in this idea.

The Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza constitutes more than one-third of the inhabitants of Greater Israel. Together with Israeli Arabs and Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, they constitute about 45 percent of this population. Sari Nusseibeh noted a few years ago, when he was a lecturer at Bir Zeit University, that if the Palestinians were to sit quietly and let Israel establish more and more settlements and annex the West Bank and Gaza, their victory would be assured.

The argument is well-known: Israel, if it attempted to swallow the West Bank and Gaza, with their three-and-a-half million inhabitants, would be suffocated. If Israel kept the Palestinians under an apartheid regime or in artificial enclaves, and if they waged their struggle nonviolently, they would quickly win the sympathies of the entire world. Israel would soon be as isolated and universally boycotted as South Africa was in its day, and it would be forced to give in.

Against this background, an organization called the Common Ground News Service (which is part of a larger organization that deals with conflict resolution) has embarked on a media campaign aimed at explaining to the Palestinian public why it is worth their while to use nonviolent methods and how such methods should be used. The campaign includes articles in Palestinian and Arab newspapers, such as Al-Hayat in London and Al-Quds and The Jerusalem Times in Jerusalem.

Thus, for example, Tufik Abu-Bachar, a member of the Palestinian National Council who lives in Jordan, wrote that in 1974, when the Palestine Liberation Organization decided to set up a state in any part of Palestine that it succeeded in liberating, that was essentially a declaration that the Palestinians do not have to wage an armed struggle, as called for in the PLO charter; rather, they can and should use diplomatic methods. He said the first intifada succeeded because it was essentially nonviolent. It is true that people threw stones, which is a form of violence, but it is a very limited one, with largely symbolic significance, calling to mind the ancient ritual that was part of the pilgrimage to Mecca (the hajj), in which the pilgrims stoned the devil with actual stones.

Abu-Bachar said the use of weapons and violence during the current intifada and the killing of civilians have caused the Palestinians to lose international sympathy. Additionally, Israelis who used to be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause have ceased to be so. He cited petitions and opinion polls that show that most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe in nonviolent struggle and think that such a struggle brings out the weakness of the stronger party, who is unable to employ his full strength against the weaker side.

Embarrassment works

Another interesting article, written by journalist Mohammed Dararma of Nablus, dealt with the use of the arts as nonviolent weapons. He described a demonstration by Palestinian musicians, actors and artists in April 2001, in which they marched on an Israel Defense Forces roadblock between Ramallah and Jerusalem singing, playing instruments and dancing. The demonstrators caused the soldiers great embarrassment. He also described demonstrations by doctors, by farmers who came to work their fields in areas to which the IDF had forbidden entry, and a large demonstration in Ramallah by activists who banged cooking pots and garbage can lids. All of these aroused enormous international sympathy.

Many people charge that Palestinian art - particularly drawings, photographs and poetry - is imbued with incitement to violence. But Dararma thinks this is part of the struggle against the occupation, and he believes that in general, Palestinian art urges life, not death.

Attorney Jonathan Kuttab described the internal debate that has raged in Palestinian society for years over whether to apply for redress to the Israeli courts. A well-known Palestinian adage warns: "If the judge is your enemy, to whom can you complain?" Kuttab's article argues that the Israeli legal system has indeed caused the Palestinians tremendous frustration, as it is a system that has granted legitimacy to land expropriations, the settlements and house demolitions. He goes into detail on the struggle against the use of torture in interrogations of Palestinian suspects and describes the Landau Committee Report, which permitted the Shin Bet to use "moderate physical pressure" during interrogations. But despite all this, he thinks that belief in the justice of the Palestinian struggle creates an opening for increased use of the Israeli legal system as one element of a nonviolent struggle.

Other people who are encouraging the use of nonviolence are the groups of volunteers from abroad who come to help the Palestinians. Dr. William Thompson, an American clinical psychiatrist, described how these volunteers manage to embarrass the Israeli government when it forbids their entry into Israel and deports those who succeed in reaching the West Bank or Gaza.

The most common methods of nonviolent struggle are demonstrations, marches, sit-ins, conferences and petitions. The Palestinians make widespread use of all of these - for instance, in the broad public campaign now being waged for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Photographs of Palestinian women carrying pictures of their jailed sons are published every day in the Palestinian press. The problem is that even quiet demonstrations have sometimes quickly degenerated into violence. Teenagers and young men throw stones, and Israeli soldiers respond with tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets that have more than once caused serious injuries or even death.

Against the authors of this series of articles (only some of which have been published so far) and their supporters are ranged the perpetrators of the attacks - Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah cells (the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) and the leftist organizations (PFLP and DFLP) - who utterly reject the idea of nonviolence. To date, it seems they have garnered more support among the public in the territories than have proponents of nonviolence. Now, however, it may very well be possible to speak of growing support for Abu Mazen's statements against "the militarization of the intifada."

The definition fence
The fence is ruthless, there's no doubt about it. However, its ruthlessness is the kind of cruelty that no great historical process can do without.
By Ari Shavit	| Aug. 7, 2003 | 12:00 AM

True, there's something repulsive about this fence. It cuts through the country, slicing up the landscape and blocking off entire populations. It limits freedom of movement and denies right of access and prevents the movement of goods. Yes, Meron Benvenisti is right when he says the separation fence has something antigeographic, antihistorical and antihuman about it. After all, anyone who travels the length of the fence cannot escape the feeling that it is some monstrous engineering giant imposed on the hills by a super powerful entity. Anyone traveling its length cannot escape the association with East Germany.

The name is also terrible. The concept of a separation fence is indeed an apartheid concept. When one side, the stronger side, unilaterally separates itself from the other, weaker side, the connotations are indeed South African. When an armed, organized state stretches a barbed wire fence against pregnant women and hardworking people, it turns the stomach. The concrete wall that Israel is trying to place between it and the Palestinian misery is, of necessity, perceived as the brutal iron wall of mastery.

Nonetheless, the fence is vital. But, not for security reasons, nor for immediate political reasons. The fence is vital because it is not a separation fence. It is a definition fence, a fence that for the first time defines the extent of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. A fence that once and for all defines Israeli sovereignty.

Official Israel, of course, denies this. Official Israel wants to regard the fence as a security-engineering project of limited significance. However, precisely because of its oversized monstrous dimensions, it is clear the fence is a constitutional enterprise. Precisely because of its brutality in determining the facts on the ground, it is clear that it is impossible to retreat from it. The hard lines it draws in the landscape are going to be our borders. The new reality it is shaping will become the reality of our life in the coming generation.

That's no simple matter. For years, Zionism has been accused of being in constant ferment, internal and external chaos, refusing to define its limits, to say what belongs to it and what does not. The inability of the Jewish state to create for itself a defined geographic envelope doomed it to a state of perpetual disquiet in its identity. It was a situation in which it wasn't clear to citizens and neighbors, what Israelis were killing and dying for.

Now, thanks to the 600 violent kilometers of the definition fence, that matter has been decided. Israel knows its limits. For the route of the fence indeed defines Israel as a democratic Jewish nation state that covers some 80 percent of the western land of Israel. It defines it as a rational coastal country, pragmatic and life-seeking.

It is important to be precise in this. The route of the fence is not the route of peace. When there is peace, the border will more or less match the 1967 lines. However, for peace to be constituted here the Palestinians have to recognize the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. They have to give up the right of return. Therefore, the existential role of the fence is to create the geographic platform from which it is possible to narrow the occupation as much as possible before peace arrives. Its function is to start the lengthy, complicated surgery of defining the Siamese Israeli and Palestinian twins and separating them.

The fence is ruthless, there's no doubt about it. However, its ruthlessness is the kind of cruelty that no great historical process can do without. When the time comes, when on both sides of the new definition fence there will be clear and distinct dimensions of identity, maybe it will be possible to give up the fence, but even then it would be best not to smash it. It would be best to plant the flora of the land along it. Figs and dates, perhaps.

Last month, the eminent Palestinian pollster, Dr. Khalil Shikaki, released a poll on the Palestinian "right of return." He arrived at a striking conclusion: "It is now clear that an Israeli recognition of the refugees' right of return does not carry with it the kind of risks that Israelis have always feared." This claim has since garnered widespread international media attention, from the New York Times to the Wall Street Journal. But sadly, Shikaki's own data does not support it.

In the poll, Shikaki presented a sample of Palestinian respondents from the disputed territories, Lebanon, and Jordan with a hypothetical situation. The respondents were told that the Palestinian leadership had been offered by Israel a proposed solution to the refugee problem along the lines of the January 2000 Taba negotiations. The polling question stipulated that only "a small number of refugees" would be allowed to "return" to Israel and that the Palestinian leadership had already accepted the terms of the proposal.

When informed of these facts, only 10 percent of the Palestinian respondents said that they wanted to "return to Israel and become an Israeli citizen."

In contrast, the strong majority of Palestinians (71 percent) preferred to reside in a future Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank, or their host country or to relocate to "designated areas inside Israel that would be swapped later on with Palestinian areas as part of a territorial exchange." Those who opted against relocating to Israel proper were also promised "fair [economic] compensation."

Shikaki interpreted this data to mean that Palestinians are uninterested in overrunning Israel demographically with unfettered emigration. Yet Shikaki fails to consider other interpretations, namely that Palestinians generally do not want to become "Israeli citizens" or move to Israel if only a "small number" of Palestinians will be living there. The relatively shallow support for "becoming an Israeli citizen" and "returning" to Israel in "small numbers" may indicate nothing more than a broad-based desire to relocate to Israel under more propitious circumstances. Indeed, Shikaki downplays a noteworthy finding: According to his own data, 95 percent of Palestinian respondents agree with the statement that the "right of return" is a "sacred right that can never be given up."

Furthermore, although a surprisingly large percentage of respondents were willing to resettle outside of Israel proper if the Palestinian leadership went along with it, Shikaki minimizes the true feelings of the Palestinian public. In fact, "When asked how the respondents themselves feel about the proposal," half said that they are presently opposed to compromising with Israel on the refugee problem.

Shikaki's polling data may highlight an unforeseen discrepancy between what Palestinians might accept from their leadership and their own private political preferences. But Shikaki shies away from the obvious conclusion: Palestinians might moderate their positions toward Israel if their leaders demonstrated more leadership on the refugee problem.

Finally, Shikaki's poll is deceptive because it deceives the respondents themselves. True, an unexpectedly large percentage of respondents were willing to accept "fair compensation" in return for relinquishing their dream of emigrating to Israel. But the respondents were apparently unaware that their expected compensation was wildly unrealistic. According to Shikaki's own data, 65 percent of the respondents believed that "a fair compensation should be between $100,000 and $500,000" for each refugee family. In the poll (which relatively few people have evidently probed), Shikaki himself admits, "The estimates for a fair compensation were much higher than the estimates of what would actually be paid."

Shikaki thus presented the respondents with a false choice and has since minimized the admittedly skewed results.

Regrettably, Dr. Shikaki's misleading interpretation of his data has already altered the discourse on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. A Wall Street Journal lead editorial recently stated, "The prospects for peace are certainly brighter today than they have been at any time in the past three years....The silent majority of Palestinians seem ready for compromise, as demonstrated again recently by a poll showing that most refugees are not interested in exercising a right of return to Israel." There may well be some signs that the road map is gaining traction, but Shikaki's poll, in fact, says little to suggest that the Palestinian public has significantly moderated its position on the "right of return."

Regarding "The Definition Fence" by Ari Shavit, August 7:

The op/ed piece jumps too quickly to assert that the fence/wall now defines the border of Israel even though Ari Shavit, admits it is "an apartheid concept." First, it overlooks the cease-fire line available since 1967 as an internationally recognized border, to which Israel agreed in signing United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. Second, it violates the road map (agreed to by Israel), which requires that the border be negotiated. Third, the negotiations were expected by the Quartet to begin with the line of Resolution 242. Fourth, Israel already has the lion's share, 78 percent, of Mandate Palestine. Does it really need the added land captured by the fence?

The fence/wall is not immutable any more that the infamous Berlin Wall. It could readily be toppled by Israeli bulldozers. I strongly believe in a secure Israel, but am convinced it won't be possible if its closest neighbor is deprived of more than the 22 percent (full West Bank and Gaza) it has agreed to.

Much has been said recently about rough treatment of foreign correspondents by Israeli officials and security people. Without commenting on the various stories and anecdotes of my colleagues, here in another one.

I have been a correspondent in Israeli for the Swiss daily paper Neue Z?rcher Zeitung for the past 16 years. Recently I have been traveling in and out of Israel about once a month - with my laptop computer - without experiencing any problem.

Last month an unfortunate incident happened to me in Zurich. On my way to the airport, my hand luggage was stolen. In it were my return ticket to Israel and my passport. I convinced the border police in Zurich to let me travel without my passport. I would take upon myself the risk of being refused entry. (The carrier, Swiss, trying to earn a windfall profit, did make me buy another ticket, however.)

Upon arrival at Ben-Gurion airport, shortly before 4 A.M., I went to the booth without a line (for crews and diplomats) and explained the problem to the border policewoman: "I am a Swiss national and have arrived without my passport because it was stolen in Zurich." Fortunately I had in my possession the press card issued by the Government Press Office, which carries my picture, and presented that.

The woman called a colleague, who asked me to sit and wait. In almost any other country, democratic or totalitarian, this would have been the start of a frustrating experience with an uncertain outcome. At a minimum the wait would have lasted until 9 A.M., when the Swiss Embassy would open its office, followed by endless interrogations and verifications. To my surprise the procedure at Ben-Gurion Airport was completely different. The police woman took my GPO card to the clerk of the Interior Ministry whose office is located just behind the booths. He compared the picture on the GPO card with the picture that was in the computer, took a look at me, and told the policewoman that everything was okay. Thereupon, she issued me a visa on a piece of paper, and instructed me to get my passport stamped by the Interior Ministry in Jerusalem as soon as I got the replacement from the Swiss Embassy. The whole procedure took less than half an hour. At 4:30 A.M. I was in a taxi on my way to Jerusalem.

Arik `73 surrenders to Ariel `03
Recent publications on the Yom Kippur War recalled "Arik" the general, who urged his troops to "screw" the Egyptians and cross the Suez Canal. It's difficult to believe. Sharon of 2003 is passive. He rarely takes the initiative, preferring to do nothing while waiting for time to act in his favor.

Recent publications on the Yom Kippur War recalled "Arik" the general, who urged his troops to "screw" the Egyptians and cross the Suez Canal. It's difficult to believe. The behavior of the current prime minister is not reminiscent of the combative corps commander of 1973. Sharon of 2003 is passive. He rarely takes the initiative, preferring to do nothing while waiting for time to act in his favor.

Sharon's patience gave Israel political stability and public calm, which was vital under the fire of the intifada and especially after the years of quick-draw zigzagging by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak. However after two and a half years in office, there are growing signs of the disadvantages of a leadership that only reacts and is deterred by risks.

The separation fence affair is the best example of Sharon"s weakness. For good or bad, the fence is the outstanding national project of his administration. The barbed wire and concrete walls are his Dimona reactor, his national water carrier, and his draining of the Hula swamps. True, those projects were also approved in a rather round-about manner, without sufficient public criticism, and were justified in terms of Zionist ideology and national needs.

But the history of the fence has broken the Israeli record for meandering decision making. It imposed itself on the previous government, which didn't want it, through a combination of public anxiety about terrorism and effective lobbying by a posse of politicians like Dan Meridor, Haim Ramon, and the mayors of towns on the seam line, and of senior officials, like Avi Dichter, Amos Yaron, Shlomo Aharonishki, and Uzi Dayan.

Sharon was never enthusiastic about the fence and doubted its efficacy. He vehemently opposed Barak's proposal, to unilaterally withdraw to a border according to "the Camp David map," which would have annexed the large settlement blocs. From the minute he was dragged into the project, Sharon tried to pretend it didn't exist or at least minimized its importance. Over and over he emphasized that it is neither a political nor a security fence, but a tactical obstacle to delay terrorists. That approach prevented him from turning the fence into a political card to play against the Americans.

Sharon accurately reckoned the Americans would oppose a fence in the middle of the West Bank stretching around Kedumim and Ariel. So, back in April he froze the construction in those areas. But instead of using the time to reach a quiet agreement with the administration, he adopted a wait and see approach - but time turned out to be against him this time. The Palestinians undertook an effective campaign against the Israeli "apartheid wall." And did intelligence alert the politician to how the Palestinians would present the case? Did the government prepare in advance?

The Americans were persuaded the Palestinians were right and Sharon suffered public criticism from President Bush. The entire world saw there are cracks in the coordination between the prime minister"s office and the White House. Now Sharon has been forced to fold and bring the fence back to the Green Line, but on his way back from Washington he discovered he was alone, and nobody is ready to share that responsibility with him.

Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz sticks to his recommendations to move the fence east of Ariel. As far as he is concerned, Sharon knows the alternatives and if he wants to change the route, let the prime minister decide on his own and bring the decision to the government for ratification. Mofaz's calculation is simple - he is fighting for his position at the top of the Likud and does not want to appear to be making concessions. Thus Sharon is stripped of the "professional" recommendation from the defense establishment to justify moving the fence, just as Netanyahu promised there was no financial problem and blocked the excuse of "budget cuts."

Sharon is now stuck with the white elephant of the fence, and is paying the price with international pressure - still not protected from terror attacks into the underbelly of the country. The responsibility for the failure is Sharon's, for being dragged into his decision by reality rather than trying to shape it. After all, it's not possible that he sat and waited for pressure from the Americans, just to kill the project.

People and Politics / Actually, it's called Spartaheid
There have been innumerable stories in recent months about how the separation fence has cut off Palestinian parents from their children, and farmers from their land.
By Akiva Eldar	| Sep. 16, 2003 | 12:00 AM

There have been innumerable stories in recent months about how the separation fence has cut off Palestinian parents from their children, and farmers from their land. In the case of Baka al-Garbiyeh, which is inside Israel and the village to its east, Nazlat Issa, which is in the West Bank, there's no need to ask the residents what they think about the fence. Just take a gander at the state's response to a petition by a resident of the area against the fence, because his land was going to be expropriated for a "secondary" fence east of Nazlat Issa, between it and Baka al-Sharkiya, the West Bank town.

When the fence was planned for west of Nazlat Issa, the state told the High Court: "The village of Nazlat Issa grew in urban contiguity with Baka al-Garbiyeh, which is inside Israel and residents of the villages are from the same families, and have close familial, social and economic ties. Placing the obstacle between the two villages would have caused significant physical damage in the form of demolition of buildings to enable an operational zone for the armed forces, as well as breaking the social fabric. That might have resulted in harsh resistance from the population and potentially, attacks on the patrols along the obstacle."

It sounds very convincing but since that response was submitted to the High Court, the state changed the route - and apparently its mind about the damage that would be done to the residents. The army has managed to demolish buildings in Nazlat - mostly shops and stalls in the open market - which are along the route of a fence that will cut off the village from their relatives in Baka al-Garbiyeh. The "secondary" fence on this route is proceeding quickly (with the help of jailed soldiers from Prison Six).

Where did the concern about the social fabric disappear? What happened to the potential for attacks against patroling forces? Defense Ministry officials explain that it turned out the demolished buildings were illegal and that the original route would have not allowed enough of an "an operations zone." Furthermore, say the officials, the freedom of movement between Nazlat in the territories and Baka al-Garbiyeh inside Israel will lead to a "back door right of return." Besides, to visit their relatives, all the Nazlat Issa residents have to do is walk seven kilometers to the gate in the fence.

Teething problems

On a hot afternoon, a long line of Palestinian cars waited on the road from Zita in the West Bank, to the nearby village of Nazlat Issa, a few minutes away by car. On both sides of the fence that has gone up in the area, vehicles were gathered - trucks laden with goods and a few yellow taxis full of workers.

Two young policemen, in Border Police uniforms and flak vests, examined the passengers and with obvious boredom peered into the trunks of the cars. Suddenly, the two loudly ordered everyone to back up, and they closed the gate. One deigned to explain to us that it was their "red light" maneuver. Whenever someone touches the fence anywhere along it in their zone, the command and control post orders the gates closed.

A little while later, after the line of cars grew even longer, word came through it was a false alarm. "It happens a few times a day," said one of the soldiers, as he walked slowly toward the closed gate. "This time it was some workers who touched the gate. Who knows, maybe in the winter, the rain will set off the alarm."

The Defense Ministry says that these are teething problems that will soon be solved. In any case, under cover of bombings and assassinations and Mahmoud Abbas' resignation and the possibility of Arafat's expulsion, a new problem has landed in the Palestinian territories. For more than two months, Border Police have been stopping the pedestrians between neighboring villages, and according to a B'Tselem report that has been given to the Justice Ministry's Police Investigations Unit, those areas have become a new zone in which Palestinians are abused. According to evidence in B'Tselem's hands, security officers camouflaged as workers, arrest Palestinians who wait at the gateways to Israel for Israeli employers and then beat them.

The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and the consulate in Jerusalem sends officials to patrol the seam routine. They also find it difficult to understand why Israel does not make do with one fence, along a route as close as possible to the Green Line. Washington is waiting for answers. A senior western diplomat is promising that if the explanations are not reasonable, the U.S. will insist that Israel dismantle the "secondary fence" and let the Palestinians out of the corrals.

The "secondary fence" method, which is turning Palestinian communities into corrals, has not skipped the "Jerusalem envelope" plan. During a visit last Friday to the south and eastern stretches of the fence, organized by the Israel-Palestine Committee for Research and Information (IPCRI), it became very clear how the fence is cutting through Tsur Baher and surrounding it, cutting it off from its neighbor, East Talpiot.

Workers and schoolchildren from Tsur Baher are not going to be allowed to leave or go home except when the gate is opened. Sheikh Sa'ad, also surrounded by a fence, doesn't even have a gate yet, though the settlers have been given magnetic cards that open any of the barriers on the "green path" prepared for them at every gate.

On the basis of security rationale, efforts have begun to plan for the expropriation of large amounts of land from the village of Hirbe Mizmoriye, east of Har Homa. The first stage calls for a Border Police base for troops who patrol the fence, but in the zoning plans presented this week, the area is colored dark yellow, meaning it is to be densely populated.

According to an official involved in the fence planning, the Jerusalem "envelope" fence will similarly corral Azzariyeh, Abu Dis, Anata, Hizme, al Zaim, al Ran, and Dahiyat al Barid, which all border the seam line. The only connection they will have to the Palestinian hinterland will be through a narrow road or tunnel, under Israeli control - a complete fulfillment of Sharon's vision of a Palestinian state on 42 percent of the West Bank, with territorial contiguity in the sky or underground.

According to Dr. Menachem Klein, who was on Ehud Barak's team as an expert on Jerusalem, the fence is part of a plan to undermine the Arab Jerusalem metropolitan area, and to rule it without annexing it. "The future plan is to cut off about a quarter of a million Jerusalem Palestinians from their social, political, economic, cultural, and linguistic hinterland in the West Bank. The concrete blocks and ramparts blockades at the entrance to East Jerusalem neighborhoods that lead west, the mobile checkpoints and the constant checks by police and soldiers emphasizes the isolation of the residents of the seam area from their city.

Klein says the right-wing government wants to change the reality on the ground created by the Oslo Accords and to uproot the change in consciousness that took place in 2000 during the negotiations over the permanent agreement in Jerusalem. He notes that during those talks, various models for dividing Jerusalem and control over it between Israel and the Palestinian state were discussed. "The right-wing government won't be satisfied with that. It wants exclusive Israeli control over all the territory annexed in 1967. That's why they have to undermine the metropolitan area of Arab East Jerusalem, both by damaging its periphery and by weakening the city itself, cutting it off from its natural hinterland. They hope conditions in the besieged areas will become so difficult the Arab residents will prefer to leave. That would degrade East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in 1967 and has been discriminating against ever since.

Thus, the authority of the Palestinian state will be very weak in the metropolitan Jerusalem area and non-existent in East Jerusalem. The proper name for this is Spartaheid, apartheid through the means and arguments of Sparta."

Gas profits

At the height of the most recent crisis, a letter carrying the Egyptian eagle in its letterhead landed on the desk of Eli Landau, chairman of the Israel Electric Corp. Ibrahim Salah Mahmud, chairman of the Egyptian National Gas Company, wanted to make clear to Landau that the decision to sell natural gas to Israel through a underwater pipe from El Arish, remains in effect. The letter essentially was a denial of Israeli press reports that the Egyptian oil minister refuses to sell gas to Israel, because of the political situation.

Mahmoud promised to guarantee that the deal would be up to seven million cubic meters of gas a year, for 20 years. And just to make sure the message got through, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's bureau chief asked Israeli Ambassador in Egypt Gideon Ben-Ami, and the charges d'affaires in the Egyptian Embassy in Israel, Tarik al Kuny, to pass on an official message to the government of Israel: The Egyptian commitment to the project is irreversible. Apparently when it comes to gas, meaning money, meaning Egyptian interests, all the assassinations or even expulsions are no obstacle, not when it comes to competition with the Palestinian gas found off the Gazan coast that British Gas wants to sell to Israel.

An outcome too terrible to imagine
One of the most dramatic geo-political changes in the history of the region is taking place at record speed and without any public debate. Before it becomes too late, we must take time out to look through the veil of lies about the fence.
By Yigal Bronner	Sep. 17, 2003 | 12:00 AM

The morning after the horrific suicide bombing at Cafe Hillel in Jerusalem, Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked on the radio whether this was the right time to cut the defense budget. Netanyahu reiterated his promise that the funds earmarked for what is known as the separation fence will not be reduced and will even be pumped in faster to accelerate its construction. This will be done in order to guarantee the security of Israeli civilians. It never occurred to the radio host to ask whether the fence would, indeed, guarantee security. As in other areas, the escalating violence and heated emotions rule out any alternative views.

One of the most dramatic geo-political changes in the history of the region is taking place at record speed and without any public debate. Before it becomes too late, we must take time out to look through the veil of lies about the fence.

The first lie is in the title. The so-called separation fence promises the worn-out and worried public that the Palestinians, and all the troubles that contact with them entails, will be tucked safely behind the fence. We are on one side, they are on the other, and that's that. The alignment of the fence will, in reality, annex much of the West Bank to Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians will still be living west of the fence, on the Israeli side. Thousands of settlers will be living east of it. Call it what you will - separation it ain't.

The second lie is that this fence marks a border, and that the Palestinian State that Sharon speaks of will be established east of it. This is not one fence, but at least two sets of walls. And while one of them, the western one, will steal as much Palestinian land as possible along the Green Line, the other one, the eastern one, will be annexing remote settlements. Several other obstacles, including fences and ditches, will be created between the two walls. This system will turn the populated areas of the West Bank into uncontiguous pens.

Take Jerusalem, for example. The wall that is currently being built there is not on the line separating the Palestinian neighborhoods from the Jewish ones. Instead, it crosses through all the Palestinian areas in town and will be annexing more than 100,000 Palestinians to Israel. Moreover, the hundreds of thousands who will be left outside the wall will not only be barred from entering the city, making their living there, going to school and getting medical care, but they will not be able to get such services from cities to the east - since from the east they will be surrounded by the walls and roads that will be built around Ma'aleh Adumim, Pisgat Zeev, Nokdim and Tekoa.

One can hardly imagine the scope of humanitarian problems that these walls on the east side of the Jerusalem metropolitan area will create as they slash the region into an intricate system of unconnected compounds. But the promise of security that the fence carries with it turns the Israeli ear deaf to any humanitarian arguments.

And the third lie about the wall, again through the Jerusalem prism: East Jerusalem was the calmest Palestinian region during the current intifada. The wall will divide families and streets and leave us with many people who have nothing to lose. This is a giant barrel of explosives.

Of course this is true of other areas, as well. And yes, there are places - a few - where the fence will be built along the Green Line and will not be annexing any Palestinian population to Israel, as in the case of Tul Karm and Qalqilyah. But anyone who believes that at least there the fence will promise us quiet is deluding themselves. Gaza is a fascinating case study for this theory: it is so quiet there that the Israel Defense Forces repeatedly asks for permission to invade and the air force bombs the region time and time again. There is no need to elaborate on the extent of security that the fence around Gaza has given the residents of Sderot and Ashkelon.

By manipulating the genuine concerns of Israeli civilians, Sharon's cabinet is building a system of fences that will not provide any separation, will not create a border and will not guarantee security, either. The purpose of these walls is entirely different: they are designed to make it impossible to weaken the stronghold that Israel has gained in the territories occupied in 1967. Eighteen months from now, we will be awakening to an entirely different reality. Ours will be a brutal land of pens stretching between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean that will make South African apartheid pale. The outcome is too terrible to even imagine.

S. African interior minister: Israel is not apartheid
By Yossi Melman	| Sep. 23, 2003 | 12:00 AM

"I certainly understand," says Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi as he passes through the metal detector like everyone else in the strict security screening at the entrance to the Tel Aviv University auditorium.

South Africa's minister for home affairs rejects calling the Israeli occupation and its treatment of Palestinians "apartheid," as do Palestinian leaders and their supporters in the European left and the Third World.

"The Israeli regime is not apartheid. It is a unique case of democracy," he said in an interview with Haaretz yesterday between debates in the conference marking Shimon Peres' 80th birthday.

If the Palestinians asked him, he would advise them to avoid violence and to prefer negotiations. "Armed struggle and violence do not solve problems, only create them, and generate more violence, in a vicious circle of revenge and counter revenge, as happened [in South Africa]."

Buthelezi is a perennial rival of the African National Congress (ANC) ruling party in South Africa. In his youth he was a member of the ANC, because it adhered, he says, to the principles of non-violence, on which its action was based since its foundation in 1912. But in the `60s, especially after Nelson Mandela's arrest, the ANC opted for armed struggle and set up a military branch for guerrilla warfare. The white apartheid regime called its actions terrorism.

Buthelezi, a Zulu prince, abandoned the movement and in 1975 founded the Inkhata Freedom Party which he presides over to this day. ANC leaders accused him of splitting the black consensus in South Africa and tried to persuade him to rejoin them and support the use of political violence, but he remained firm. Later they branded him as a traitor and collaborator with apartheid.

"I came to Israel on an official visit in 1985, and I was received by Shimon Peres, who was then Israel's prime minister in a manner which was indeed extraordinary. He showed toward me enormous warmth and great empathy toward our struggle for liberation. However, what was most remarkable was his understanding of the real nature of the struggle for liberation in the Republic of South Africa."

For this he still feels obliged to express his admiration of Peres. Buthelezi says in those days most foreign observers believed a simplified version of the South African conflict, a Disney-like image of a struggle between a unified righteous black majority and an oppressive and evil white minority."

His continuing opposition to President Thabo Mbeki and his party is evident in almost every second sentence. Recently he set up a new political bloc with Tony Leon, the leader of the Democratic Union, who also came for Peres's celebrations. The new bloc constitutes 28 percent of South Africa's parliament and Buthelezi intends to challenge Mbeki in presidential elections next April. He and his aides express hopes that he could win. However, since on this visit he represents the South African government, most of whose positions he opposes, he had to say that "as I was taught by my professor, every coin has two sides."

He says he knows Yasser Arafat well and if he were on an official visit he would be keen to meet him. "Both sides need to avoid violence. It's a double-edged sword, as our experience taught us."

Legality is in the eye of the beholder
The international community believes the settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention and may even be a war crime under the terms of the International Criminal Court. Israel disagrees. The Supreme Court almost always has refused to take a stand on the issue. And so far, the U.S. has blocked all attempts to impose international sanctions on Israel.
By Moshe Gorali	Sep. 25, 2003 | 12:00 AM

Israel is so confident of the unassailable legality of its settlements in the territories that Dr. Alan Baker, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, is himself a settler, residing in Har Adar. "I live beyond the Green Line," says Baker, "but my home is not registered with the Israel Lands Administration, which is the case for all the settlements. Instead, I have a long-term rental agreement that is contingent on any future peace agreement. This is the condition by which all settlers must abide. Whether or not they are aware of or agree to this situation, they have no permanent resident status and are powerless to change their status or the land's ownership."

It is highly doubtful that most settlers share Baker's views on the transitoriness of their residence in the territories. Their leaders have repeatedly declared that they will remain in the territories forever and that, in doing so, they are obeying a divine command that transcends any fine points of international law.

Since 1967, Israel's governments and law courts have sanctioned the settlements through legal acrobatics that have failed to satisfy the international community. The chief stumbling block is Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (of August 12, 1949), which reads: "Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive." The primary goal here is to protect local populations: not only to safeguard them physically, but also to ensure that their territory's demographic and cultural character will remain intact until the territory's status is finally determined - through repatriation or the application of the occupying country's legal code.

Baker outlines Israel's interpretation of Article 49: "The prohibition concerning the transfer of the occupying power's nationals to the occupied territory refers to forcible transfers, along the lines of what the Nazis did. Article 49 was drafted after World War II and is aimed at preventing the kind of mass population transfers the Germans carried out to alter the demographic character of the territories they occupied. Israel's policies ban forcible population transfers, but do sanction voluntary ones; Israel has refrained from expropriating private land; the scale of the transfers is too small to affect the territory's character; and, what is most important, the transfers are not permanent."

One could also argue that, in Israel's case, it is not the government that has been transferring settlers; instead, the settlers have transferred the government to the territories. The settlers' messianic fervor and organizational and logistical skills played a key role in settlement activities that the government sanctioned, sometimes de facto.

However, it should be noted, settlement activity was driven not only by ideological incentives, but by economic ones as well - especially in settlements whose establishment was accompanied by generous financial benefits intended to attract settlers and by the promise of a better quality of life.

Although Israel has not annexed the West Bank, it is trying to utilize the fact that Jordan has waived all claim to the West Bank. While it is concerned with challenging such claims as the settlements' illegality, Israel argues that the Fourth Geneva Convention, at least in those articles dealing with sovereignty issues and not in its humanitarian aspects, applies only to territory taken from a state that is a signatory to the convention. Egypt imposed military government on the Gaza Strip, whereas Jordan has conceded all sovereignty claims to the West Bank, which it annexed in 1950. (Israel and the rest of the international community, except for Britain and Pakistan, did not recognize the annexation.)

The late King Hussein's declaration that Jordan had severed all ties to the West Bank turned it into the bone of contention between Israel and a political entity that has not yet been created. This fact has made it even easier for Israel to free itself of the basic limitations imposed by international law: the prohibition against the occupying power's mixing its nationals with the local population and the prohibition against permanent, massive changes, excluding those required for security reasons or for the local population's well-being.

"The legal claim today and the arguments," Baker remarks, "rest on the Oslo accords. It was resolved - and the Palestinians agreed - that the settlements' fate would be determined in a future peace agreement. After we signed those accords, which are still legally in force, we are no longer an occupying power, but we are instead present in the territories with their consent and subject to the outcome of negotiations."

Elon Moreh was a turning point

To handle the settlement controversy politically, legally and ethically, Israel has developed a unique word-laundering system. To avoid the value judgment connoted by "occupied territories" or "liberated territories," Israel invented the term "administered territories."

Chief Supreme Court Justice Aharon Barak used the phrase "long-term occupation" to justify the Israel government's permanent, massive investments in the territories. To describe a situation where two populations, in this case one Jewish and the other Arab, share the same territory but are governed by two separate legal systems, the international community customarily uses the term "apartheid." Prof. Amnon Rubinstein has coined an alternative phrase, "enclave-based justice."

Thus, Israelis find it difficult to define the settlements as a "war crime"; they prefer instead the word "violation." In his book on Israeli constitutional law, Rubinstein writes, "In its policy of establishing settlements in the territories, irrespective of the policy's political wisdom or absence thereof, Israel has clearly violated international law: It has violated the prohibitions concerning an occupying power's transferring nationals to the territory it occupies and concerning the expropriation of land for purposes unrelated to the local population's well-being. Regarding these two categories of violation, Israel's High Court of Justice has been unable to restrain the executive branch of Israeli government - perhaps because of the court's awareness of the issue's political nature."

In discussing the High Court's treatment of the settlement question, one must speak of two eras: the period prior to the famous Elon Moreh judgment of 1979 and the period following that judgment.

Prior to 1979, the High Court did not intervene when Israel expropriated territory, even privately owned lands. The justices of the Supreme Court, in its capacity as High Court of Justice, would automatically accept the argument of the country's civilian and military leaders that the expropriation in question was needed for security reasons. Elon Moreh exposed the Supreme Court justices to a very different reality: Here the expropriation was for civil, even ideological, reasons. The security pretext was put forward only later on.

The combination of the expropriation of private land and the civilian nature of the expropriation's purposes exceeded the tolerance level even of a Supreme Court justice with a rightist outlook like Moshe Landau, who ordered the settlement's evacuation. "The Dawikat [the Arab petitioner's surname] verdict is the only court decision in Israeli judicial history where an Israeli court of law ordered the destruction of a Jewish settlement," attorney Plia Albek would later write.

Albek, who then headed the Justice Ministry's civil law department and was the settlers' darling, made the best of a bad situation. She transformed the High Court's prohibition concerning the expropriation of private land into massive authorization for seizure of public land in the territories. The use of "security reasons" to justify an expropriation was replaced by almost limitless authorization for seizing public land.

Prior to 1977, the policy governing the establishment of settlements was subject to military needs, in the spirit of the Labor Party's traditional intertwining of security needs with the need for settling the land. A few years ago, Albek wrote about this issue: "When the Likud came to power in 1977, this policy underwent a dramatic change. The Likud's approach was that, on the one hand, Jewish settlements should be founded to settle the Land of Israel, and that, on the other hand, the rights of individuals to their assets must be protected. This policy, established by then prime minister Menachem Begin, was firmly consolidated and backed by then attorney general Aharon Barak and was precisely implemented in hundreds of statements of professional opinion written by Barak and by the undersigned."

Following the Elon Moreh affair, the next stage of the High Court's handling of the settlement issue began: Now the court had to deal with petitions aimed at settlements established on public land. However, here the High Court refrained from dealing head-on with the settlements' legality and used arguments that are a classic example of judicial restraint and self-control: "The subject cannot be judged in a court of law" or "The petitioners have no standing in this issue" or "This court will not intervene in a subject that is the province of another branch of the government, especially because this subject might in future be settled in political negotiations."

Attorney Avigdor Feldman, who has appeared before the bench in all the significant petitions presented to the High Court regarding the settlements: "The Supreme Court has always been the settlements' loyal babysitter - starting with the question of land expropriation when the court automatically accepted the `security needs' argument - Elon Moreh was an exception - and ending with the rejection of petitions against the settlements because of `lack of status' - words that, in any other context, are utterly meaningless."

`He's not Arab, he's Norwegian'

The first major verdict after Elon Moreh was given in Peace Now's petition and bears the name of the movement's then secretary general, Gavriel Bargil. Former Supreme Court president, Justice Meir Shamgar, wrote in that verdict: "Courts of law deal with concrete, specific disputes and disagreements, not with abstract political debates. This court will not discuss foreign, security or social policies, when the legal action or the petition is not directly related to a defined dispute."

Another member of the bench, Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg, added in the above verdict: "There is no room for a judicial decision that does not pertain to individual rights when an extremely important and extremely significant political process is still under way. This is the kind of case that we have before us and which is at the heart of the peace process, which is of supreme importance. Any verdict that would be handed down by this court might be considered direct intervention in the peace process." Goldberg added a sharp reprimand to the petitioners who, in his view, had tried to compromise the High Court: "The petitioners have the right to place a `juridical land mine' on the threshold of this courthouse; however, this court must scrupulously avoid stepping on that land mine, which could end up destroying the court's very foundations, which are the public's faith in it."

The petition was rejected in 1993, one reason for the rejection being its overly political character. Feldman returned to the High Court with a more concrete petition in 1998 - against the expropriation of land for the development of Ma'aleh Adumim. The petitioners argued that the expropriation was unrelated to the territories' administration and was intended solely to extend Jerusalem's boundaries.

The High Court justices, basing themselves on the reasons used in the Bargil case, rejected the petition. They repeated the argument that the subject could not be judged in a courtroom and that any verdict in the case could be construed as intervention in the peace process. "In these conversations between neighbors," wrote Supreme Court Justice Mishael Cheshin in his decision, referring to Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians, "Israel must speak with one voice; one voice, not one voice and an echo that conflict with one another."

Every attempt to change an occupied territory's demographic balance has two sides: first, the introduction of the occupying power's nationals, and, second, the removal of local residents. To its credit, Israel has not exiled local residents; however, it does place obstacles in the way of Palestinians who have left the territories and who wish to return. Feldman notes the judicial system's contribution to this effort: "Before the High Court, I represented an Arab who had traveled to Norway after he married a Norwegian woman. He subsequently divorced her and expressed the desire to return to his village in the West Bank. The army barred his entry, claiming he had lost his residence status. I recall Supreme Court Justice Miriam Ben-Porat cynically remarking that my client was really a `Norwegian.'

"Here was a flagrant example of the court collaborating with the army. If you are a Jew who was born in Alaska and who lived there all your life, you can receive Israeli citizenship within minutes. If you are an Arab and have lived here all your life, you can lose your resident status because of a few years you spent abroad."

The danger of being indicted by an international court

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted on July 17, 1998 and the international court it established recently began to operate. Israel did not sign the statute because of Article 8, which includes, in its definition of war crimes, the "transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies ..."

This was an Egyptian initiative to attempt to define the settlements as a war crime through the transfer of the prohibition from the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Rome Statute and through the expansion of the text ("transfer, directly or indirectly"). Egypt wanted to lead Israel into a trap. The word "indirectly" does not appear in Article 49 of the Geneva Convention. The text's expansion was intended to define as a war crime not only an act in which a state initiates the direct transfer of nationals but also an indirect transfer - the creation of an infrastructure or even "looking aside" and enabling the occupying power's nationals to take up residence in the occupied territory of their own accord.

Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein was aware that a trap was being laid for Israel and, upon his recommendation, Israel decided not to become a member of the International Criminal Court, a fact that has reduced the danger that this court could indict Israeli leaders.

Nevertheless, there is still the danger of an indictment, claims Prof. Yoram Shahar of Herzliya's Interdisciplinary Center: "The International Criminal Court obtains its authority in three ways. The first two do not `threaten' Israel. The first is the authority to indict citizens of a state that has signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and Israel is not a signatory. The second is an indictment for crimes committed on the territory of a state that has signed the statute, and the Palestinian Authority is not yet a state. The third way is the lodging of a complaint against a state and its leaders by the United Nations Security Council. Such a complaint will not be lodged as long as the United States exercises its veto. However, if the U.S. should become angry with us and withdraw its veto, all our leaders run the risk of being indicted."

What about the possibility of the settlers' evacuation? When that question is raised, the settlers themselves refer to international law, arguing that their removal would be a population transfer, a crime against humanity. For that argument to hold water, the settlement's legality would first have to be proven. However, assuming the settlers could be evacuated in a peace agreement, would there be any basis for their possible demand that they be allowed to remain as a minority in a future Palestinian state?

"Such a claim," observes Prof. Eyal Benvenisti of Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Law, "could base itself on several sources: on the existence in the field of Jewish property, for example, in the Etzion Bloc and Beit Hadassah; there are 16,000 dunams (4,000 acres) of Jewish land purchased before 1948; on the claim that there are second- and third-generation settlers for whom the territories are their `native landscape'; or on a `mirror argument' or the argument of offsetting the Palestinians' claim to a right of return. International law does not recognize that right; however, the right derives its impact from the continual repetition of its existence."

Whether the settlements are a war crime or a violation of international law, their existence has created a domino chain of offenses. To ensure the settlements' safety, land is expropriated for the paving of highways, which only the settlers are authorized to use; to protect them, entire groves are "shaved" and thus the local population's territories and sources of livelihood are eroded. In addition, a separate code of law applies to the settlers and the code's application is partial and flawed, as noted in the report by the Shamgar commission on the massacre in Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs. That report expressed criticism on the manner in which the law is enforced on settlers.

Although settlement activity has been going on for nearly 30 years, the world has not intervened. While Israel is paying a price in diplomatic and economic terms, it has managed to evade international sanctions. The principal reason is American support for Israel. Prof. Shahar has an additional explanation: "The international community is not convinced that the settlements are a serious crime. There has been no genocide here, no wholesale devastation of territory, no mass rapes, no concentration camps, no mass starvation and no systematic deportation of local residents. There has been no Kosovo or Rwanda here - the sort of situations that arouse the international community to act."

However, Prof. Shahar believes that, although Israel has not been forced to pay a price in the short run, it could wind up paying a high price in the long run. "In my opinion," he says, "the transfer of a population to a hostile territory is a serious danger in long-range terms because it perpetuates the dispute and destroys any true chances for the dispute's resolution. A classic example is the Protestant settlement in Catholic Ireland that has created perpetual tensions and hostility." n

Rutgers campus politics makes Mideast a local New Jersey issue
By Nathan Guttman	| Sep. 25, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
WASHINGTON - Ever since the intifada began, college campuses have been the principal battlefield for pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian organizations in America. The most recent engagement took place at Rutgers University in New Jersey - and it has already drawn in local politicians, Jewish organizations and the university administration.

The trouble began when a coalition of pro-Palestinian organizations decided to hold their annual convention at Rutgers in the second week of October. Last year, the event was held at Michigan University, and the year before that at Berkeley. The host organization was New Jersey Solidarity, which is considered one of the most extreme organizations in the coalition. One of the group's leaders, Charlotte Kates, for instance, told The New York Post that "Israel is a colonial settler apartheid state" that has no right even to exist, and against which suicide attacks are justifiable. In another interview, with The New York Times, she said: "It is not our place in the United States to dictate the tactics Palestinian groups use in the liberation struggle." The organization also hung posters around the campus in March that declared: "From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free."

New Jersey has both a large Jewish and a large Arab population, and news of the planned conference quickly drew reactions from local politicians. John Bennett, the Republican leader in the state senate, sent a letter to Governor James McGreevey demanding that he "prevent our prestigious and world-renowned university from hosting this abominable conference." McGreevey did meet with the university's president, but was convinced that there was no way to prevent the conference.

Then, however, objections began to be heard within the Palestinian solidarity movement itself. Some members of the New Jersey group quit, charging that the group had become too extreme and that its leaders, in internal discussions, including proposing invitations to Hamas representatives. And the coalition as a whole decided to move its annual conference from New Jersey to Ohio.

But the New Jersey group announced that it still intended to hold a Palestinian solidarity conference in October - with or without the rest of the coalition. It then applied to be registered as a Rutgers student association, which would entitle it to use the campus facilities.

That started the storm anew. McGreevey asked the university to reject the group's application, but Rutgers President Richard McCormick said that out of respect for freedom of expression, he could not refuse to register a group because of its opinions. That decision elicited thousands of protest letters and e-mails, and donors even warned that they would cancel their donations if the group were recognized. In the end, the university announced that the group failed to meet the technical requirements for recognition and its application was therefore rejected.

But New Jersey Solidarity appeared equally unfazed by this decision, and announced that the conference would still take place. "We refuse to be silenced," said Kates in a press release last week. "We will hold our conference wherever we must - in a hotel, in a park, wherever. The Palestinian people have continued to resist despite incredible and overwhelming force displayed against them - and we owe them nothing less than to refuse to be silenced."

Adding fuel to the fire was a flyer distributed on campus over the summer, allegedly by New Jersey Solidarity, calling for an "Israel hate fest" and declaring: "We can't kill Israelis but we can hate them." The group denied any connection to the flyer, and the campus Hillel organization confirmed that it had been fabricated by an extremist group to discredit New Jersey Solidarity - but the incident did nothing to calm tempers.

Now, both sides are bracing for October. New Jersey Solidarity plans to hold its conference then, while Hillel is planning a series of pro-Israel events on campus under the slogan "Israel inspires."

"We decided not to confront them, because that only gets them more publicity," explained Andrew Getraer, the head of Rutgers Hillel. Instead, he said, the group decided to present Israel's positive side.

The picture is only relatively rosy
Here's the news from the Jewish world in the Jewish calendar year of 5763: The wave of anti-Semitic attacks in Western Europe has died down; as a result, however, immigration to Israel has dropped off
By Yair Sheleg	| Sep. 25, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The most important news in the Jewish world of the past Jewish calendar year, 5763, is good news, and can almost be called "no news." The ugly wave of incidents of physical attacks against Jews in Western Europe (and particularly in France and Belgium) during the first two years of the Palestinian terror attack on Israel has abated, relatively speaking, in the past year - except for a period before and during the war in Iraq, when Islamic groups and members of the extreme left accused the Jews of warmongering.

Israeli groups that keep track of anti-Semitic incidents the world over have no organized data about the Jewish calendar year (they organize their statistics according to the civil calendar), but one of the members of the Forum to Coordinate the Struggle Against Anti-Semitism told Haaretz that the impression that there has been a certain decline in such incidents is shared by various groups that deal with the subject.

In France, the change is clearly attributed to the second Chirac government, which was established in the wake of the May 2002 elections and is composed of right-wing parties. The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem attributes the change mainly to the new French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy.

Sarkozy, who is portrayed as the Rudolph Giuliani of France (as the minister also responsible for the police), declared an all-out war on crime. Placing the blame for crime on the Muslim immigrants from North Africa was a central factor in the impressive success of the extreme right-wing politician Jean-Marie Le Pen in the first round of the presidential elections last year.

In this context, Sarkozy also changed the policy of the previous government, which was reluctant to speak specifically about "anti-Semitic incidents" and spoke about "hooliganism" in general. The new government, they say in Jerusalem, "is calling a spade a spade."

One of the expressions of change is new legislation calling for particularly severe punishment for crimes stemming from racist hatred. As part of the general mobilization to the campaign, the French Education Ministry has also begun to prepare curricula for the fight against racism.

The new policy is also important for the French for the sake of improving their image. For example, this week, Chirac, in his conciliatory visit to the United States (for the annual meeting of the UN General Assembly), made sure to meet with senior executives from the U.S. Jewish organizations and to assure them that the anti-Semitic incidents in his country are on the decline. (He even mentioned a number - about 170 anti-Semitic incidents during the first months of 2002, as compared to about 70 incidents during the parallel period this year.)

Chirac included four senior members of the French Jewish community in his delegation, so they could serve as a bridgehead for their Jewish brothers in explaining the change in French policy. Nevertheless, emphasizes the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the decline in anti-Semitic incidents in France and in Western Europe in general is relative, and the number is still high in comparison to the period prior to September 2000.

European awareness

Awareness of the existence of anti-Semitism on the continent, not to mention the need to fight it, was a central theme of two major conferences that took place this year in Europe: The first, in Paris, was a cooperative effort on the part of UNESCO and the Wiesenthal Center; and the second, which was larger and more important, was held in Vienna, in June, by the European Organization for Security and Cooperation, which is already talking about a follow-up.

Although the last conference took place only in the wake of significant American pressure, in the final analysis it was attended by an impressive representation from all the European countries, which promised to keep track of the phenomenon of anti-Semitism and to confront it.

There was also good news from other Jewish communities that have suffered from economic crises in recent years. Especially noticeable was the relative improvement in the economic situation in Argentina, and the continued improvement in the economic situation in Russia and the Ukraine - all three of them countries with relatively large Jewish communities. (In Russia there are some 270,000 Jews; in Argentina almost 200,000; and in the Ukraine about 110,000).

As usual in the pendulum of the balance of powers in the Jewish world, all the good news directly affects the second prominent headline of the year and a problematic one for Israel - the steep decline in the numbers of Jews immigrating to Israel.

In 5763, only some 30,000 immigrants arrived in Israel. And if this number could have been considered a great blessing in the 1980s, compared to the numbers to which Israel became accustomed during the 1990s (the years of the large wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union, it is, in fact, a dramatic decline.

The 1990s began with two years during which the number of immigrants approached 200,000 a year; and at the end of the decade, in one year, 1999, the number of immigrants reached about 77,000. In contrast, in each of the past three years there has been a sharp decline in the numbers - about 60,000 in 2000, some 43,000 in 2001, and around 35,000 in 2002. And during this past year, there has been a further decline.

A more specific analysis of the number of immigrants from Argentina, Russia and the Ukraine will illustrate to what extent the improvement of the situation in those countries (and on the other hand, the economic and security crisis in Israel) affects the numbers: The number of immigrants from Argentina, which rose to almost 6,000 in 2002, dropped once again in 5763, to about 3,400; only about 5,800 immigrants came to Israel this year from Russia, which in 2002 was still sending about 7,900 people to Israel; and this year from the Ukraine, from which about 2,700 immigrants came in 2002, there were only about 4,800 (the statistics are from the Jewish Agency).

This past year, for the first time, the number of Jews who immigrated from the former Soviet Union to Germany, which grants special benefits for Jewish immigrants, was greater than the number coming to Israel. At the same time, in Russia and the Ukraine, the trend of consolidation of a local Jewish community continued, with Western-style institutions and organizations.

As opposed to the situation in these countries, in France, despite the improvement in the security of Jews there, the trend of an increase in the number of immigrants continues: If in 2001 only about 1,000 immigrants came from France, the number was doubled in 2002 to about 2,000; and in 5763, it once again increased to 2,400. The assessment is that this upswing is related to the fear of French Jews that the high percentage of Muslims in France guarantees unrest for the Jews in the future as well, even if now there is relative calm.

For example, in a survey conducted about six months ago, it was found that over one quarter of French Jews are considering leaving the country because of anti-Semitism - but not necessarily for Israel. In another survey, conducted in 2002 by Dr. Erik Cohen, a sociologist who studies French Jewry, it was found that 6 percent of the French Jews (about 30,000) say that there is a "good chance" that they will immigrate to Israel.

However, even the good news regarding anti-Semitism isn't absolute. In Morocco, there were particularly severe attacks on Jews this year - five terror attacks on May 16 in Casablanca, and the murders of two Jews this past month. This aggregation of incidents seems problematic, especially in light of the assessment that it is related to the organization of extremist Muslims in the country.

Negative developments

Officials at the Israeli Foreign Ministry also point to the negative developments in several Eastern European countries, and especially Hungary, which is home to some 50,000 Jews - the largest number in Eastern Europe, outside of Russia and the Ukraine.

The situation in Hungary is very worrisome, ministry officials say, noting: "A party with a clearly anti-Semitic character is officially active there, and there are quite a number of assemblies and parades by neo-Nazis."

To deal with this activity, the Hungarian parliament in recent months has initiated legislation that will specifically outlaw racist hatred, although without specifically including anti-Semitic activity.

No less worrisome is the intensification of the sharp anti-Israeli trend in several Western centers - first and foremost, in the academic world. On campuses in North America, there are an increasing number of demonstrations against Israel (on the campus of Concordia University in Canada, the activity of the Jewish student organization, Hillel, was suspended after the organization distributed among its members flyers encouraging volunteer service in the Israel Defense Forces); lecturers and researchers compare Israeli policy in the territories to the apartheid regime that ruled in South Africa, and some are working to boycott Israeli scholars.

For the time being, the major initiatives of the anti-Israel campaign have been checked. In the United States, for example, the initiators of the campaign to stop investments by American universities in Israel failed, thanks to an opposing campaign that was spearheaded by the president of Harvard University, Lawrence Summers. Initiatives at European universities to boycott Israeli scientists have also been frustrated for the most part. But over the long term, the intensification of these attempts is a worrisome sign for Israel.

In addition, Foreign Ministry sources say, the European left, especially in France, is trying to negate Israel's very right to exist, rather than making do with criticizing its policy.

In the United States, home to the largest Jewish community in the world, this past year was marked by two events - the economic recession, which adversely affected the volume of contributions both for internal Jewish needs and for Israel; and the National Jewish Population Survey, which was published about 13 years after a previous survey.

The survey of communities preoccupied the Jewish public all year long because of a a scandal that erupted (last November) when it turned out that its publication, which was designated to coincide with the annual conference of Jewish federations, was being delayed, under the excuse that important raw data had been lost. In the final analysis, the survey was published toward the end of the Jewish calendar year, and the great drama gave rise to entirely predictable statistics - among them, continued assimilation (a 47 percent intermarriage rate in 2001 as compared to 43 percent in 1990), and a decline in the size of the American Jewish community (5.2 million people, of whom only 4.3 have a significant attachment to Judaism, as compared to 5.5 million in the earlier survey).

The most surprising finding was actually a positive one - an increase in the number of children enrolled in full-time Jewish day schools.

The bottom line of the survey was, therefore, that although the number of Jews in the United States is in fact on the decline, the Jewish "quality" of those who remain is increasing. This feeling is also reinforced by a finding that wasn't included in the survey - a growing demand for rabbis in Jewish communities, and an increase in the numbers of those enrolled in the rabbinical schools of the various religious movements.

Three out of four Israelis favor reducing the guarding of outposts
A Haaretz poll reveals that 83 percent of the public ranks acts of terror committed inside the Green Line and acts of terror against settlers as equally grave. Fifty-five percent are in favor of reducing benefits for settlers

The settlements - a burden or an asset?

Perceptions of terror in the settlements

Will evacuation of the settlements lead to civil war?

The 10 questions that appear in the Haaretz opinion poll on the public's attitude to settlers may be divided into two main groups: questions related to the current degree of affinity for the settlers, and questions related to the future of the settlements. Based on this division, it may be said that the poll offers good news, not-so-good news and genuinely bad news for the settlers.

The good news is that the responses express sympathy and solidarity, most certainly to a degree that exceeds the customary image of the attitude toward settlers. For instance, it seems that the level of affinity (on a scale of 1 to 10) that the Israeli public feels with the settlers (4.6) is identical or nearly so to that which the public feels toward the left or the ultra-Orthodox. Similarly, an overwhelming majority (83 percent) believes that terrorist acts perpetrated in settlements are of equal seriousness as terrorist acts committed inside the Green Line.

The not-so-good news has to do with the economic aspect of the settlements: More than half of the respondents (55 percent) feel they are more of an economic burden than a security asset, as opposed to 41 percent who believe that the opposite is the case. A majority of 55 percent also believes that the benefits given to settlers should be abolished or reduced.

As for the bad news (for the settlers), there is a high degree of support for removal of settlements: 57 percent of the public is prepared to remove most or all of the settlements in exchange for a peace treaty, and 40 percent of the public is prepared to evacuate at least some of them unilaterally, even without a treaty.

The poll was conducted by Dialogue on September 15, 2003 among a representative sample (including the Arab sector) of 503 respondents, under the supervision of Professor Camil Fuchs.

The settlers earned sympathy votes not only in regard to the question about affinity. On a question of historical comparison, a much higher number (42 percent) of respondents compared the settlers to the pioneers of the "tower and stockade" days, as opposed to those who compared the settlers and the Palestinians to whites and blacks under the apartheid regime in South Africa (25 percent).

An overwhelming majority (83 percent) relate to terrorist attacks inside the Green Line and in the settlements with equal severity; 12 percent consider acts of terrorism in settlements as less severe, and 3 percent as more severe. Still, 21 percent of those respondents that described themselves as politically left-wing viewed terrorism in settlements as less severe than attacks within the Green Line.

Asked about guarding of the settlement outposts, 51 percent responded that only the legal outposts should be guarded, 25 percent felt that the army should guard all of the outposts (with the clear intent of thus including the illegal outposts, as well), while 23 percent felt that the army should not be guarding any of the outposts at all. Clearly, the answers to the question indicate opposition to a continuation of the current situation, in which all of the outposts are guarded: Nearly three-quarters of the public feel that the army should not be guarding either all or some of the outposts.

A similar bias may be discerned in the two economic questions. A majority of respondents (55 percent) thinks that the settlements are more of an economic burden than a security asset, as opposed to 41 percent who think the opposite (the responses include 6 percent who feel that both statements are equally true). Nevertheless, there is no symmetry between the camps on this question; an overwhelming majority (93 percent) of the left considers the settlements an economic burden, while on the right 28 percent of the respondents feel this way.

Among all respondents, a 55-percent majority opposes economic benefits for residents of the settlements. This is divided among the 33 percent who favor their outright cancellation, and 22 percent who believe the benefits should be reduced. Some 35 percent feel that the status quo should be retained, and 10 percent believe that the benefits should be increased. Yet here too, there is no symmetry between the camps: Among supporters of the left, 91 percent feels that the benefits should be abolished or reduced, while 27 percent of rightist sympathizers share this view.

As for removal of settlements, over half of respondents (57 percent) are willing to evacuate most or all of the settlements in exchange for a peace treaty with the Palestinian Authority. This figure combines those that favor evacuation of all the settlements (18 percent) and those that favor evacuation of most of the settlements except for large blocs of settlement close to the Green Line (39 percent). Among respondents that define themselves as members of the right, close to one-third (31 percent) are prepared to remove most of the settlements in exchange for a peace treaty.

Asked about a unilateral evacuation, the hawkish camp grew in strength, encompassing about half (51 percent) of all respondents, including those who oppose any unilateral evacuation (39 percent) and those willing under such conditions to evacuate only a handful of settlements (12 percent). Conversely, 40 percent feel that most (22 percent) or all (18 percent) of the settlements should be removed, even if unilaterally. In any event, the fact is that 52 percent of the public favors the unilateral evacuation of settlements, if only a few, even without any agreement.

One of the more interesting and unequivocal findings of the poll relates to the question of protesting against a future evacuation. A large majority (78 percent) declares they would not take part in any protest activity against an "evacuation for peace" agreement. Even 62 percent of those describing themselves as right-wingers ascribe to this opinion. Conversely, 12 percent of the public would protest against such an agreement through demonstrations and petitions, 6 percent would fight it by any possible non-violent means, and 2 percent declare their willingness to fight in any way possible, including violence (among right-wingers, 4 percent declared this intention).

Yet despite the relative apathy with which the respondents themselves plan to accept such an agreement, their expectation regarding how the public would receive it is much more pessimistic. Some 18 percent feel that evacuation of the settlements carries a high probability for the outbreak of a civil war in Israel and another 22 percent feel it would lead to the moderate probability of such a scenario, although over half (53 percent) still feel that this scenario entails only slight chances of a civil war.

Results of the poll in the Arab sector reveal a few interesting findings: as expected, this group's solidarity with the settlers is the lowest of all (2.4 percent), but even among Israeli Arabs, there is a strong majority (73 percent) that considers acts of terrorism in the settlements and inside the Green Line of equal severity. Nine percent of Israeli Arabs consider the settlements a security asset. Some 41 percent of Arab respondents believe that the outposts should be guarded, including 12 percent who feel that all the settlements should be guarded, and 29 percent who would guard the legal outposts.

Forty percent of Arab respondents also feel that as part of a peace treaty, the large settlement blocs (29 percent) should be left in place, most of the settlements should be left (4 percent), or all of them should be left (7 percent). If these respondents gave sincere answers, the settlers should be encouraged by these surprising results.

Segmentation of the poll sampling by age and gender yields interesting findings. It develops that the younger respondents consistently express relatively high support for settlers. They are more inclined to compare the settlers to pioneers (46 percent among ages 18-34, as opposed to 40 percent among older adults) than to the apartheid regime; view the settlements more as a security asset (41 percent of younger adults, as opposed to 34 percent of older adults) than as an economic burden; and are even more willing to guard outposts (only 17 percent of respondents aged 18-44 believe the army should not guard the outposts at all, as opposed to 34 percent of older respondents).

As for differences between the sexes, it seems that the percentage of women that support the settlers is higher than that of men. Some 52 percent of men viewed the settlers as more of an economic burden than a security asset, as opposed to 43 percent of women. Only 18 percent of women felt that no outposts should be guarded, as opposed to 28 percent of men. Thirty percent of the women believe that no settlements should be removed, even in the framework of a peace treaty (as opposed to 18 percent of men). n

The poll was conducted on behalf of Haaretz by Dialogue, under the supervision of Professor Camil Fuchs of the Tel Aviv University Department of Statistics. It was held on September 15, 2003, among a sampling of 503 respondents, who constitute a representative sample of the adult population of Israel. With a 95 percent probability, the margin of error for each individual question does not exceed 4.37 percent.

A nod to Condoleezza
It was so easy. No stress, no voices raised. Bush just nodded to Condoleezza, Condoleezza told Weisglass, Weisglass passed the word to Sharon - and Sharon agreed to leave Arafat be, despite all the threats to have him deported or killed.

It was so easy. No stress, no voices raised. Bush just nodded to Condoleezza, Condoleezza told Weisglass, Weisglass passed the word to Sharon - and Sharon agreed to leave Arafat be, despite all the threats to have him deported or killed.

This week, the procedure is repeating itself. The same chain of command has gone into action, so facile, so friendly, with the result being that the Israeli separation fence will not encompass Ariel or lunge deep into Palestinian territory.

It is worth mentioning the submissiveness in both cases of most of Israel's government ministers, and the absence of public demonstrations. In the long run, the overwhelming majority of Israelis, with Sharon at the top of the list, realize that a head-on confrontation with the United States is not an option. Or to put it differently, there is such an option, but it would be insane.

But does the United States understand this? And if it does, then what conclusion has it drawn?

In consistently giving preference to U.S.-Israel relations over any other consideration, Sharon is articulating, in the deepest sense, the existential dilemma in which Israel finds itself. It can no longer save itself by its own means. Even Sharon, the man who dismantled Yamit in days gone by, cannot free Israel from the burden of the territories and thereby guarantee its future as a Jewish state. He cannot do so politically, and apparently not emotionally either. Sharon is not the Israeli de Gaulle.

The most Sharon is capable of doing, and is in fact doing though perhaps not intentionally, is to direct the mute cry emanating from our political impotence toward our superpower ally: Save us from ourselves!

Abu Mazen, in the few weeks of his failed government, was also sending out distress signals to Washington: Save us from the subversive, pathological rejectionism of Arafat.

True, the United States has consistently avoided using all its clout, from 1967 until today, to pry Israel away from its grip on the territories. But the more the situation goes downhill, the vision of an agreed-upon solution slips away and the Bosnian scenario looms larger, the need to save Israel from itself - and the region from catastrophe - becomes a more vital and pressing American interest.

Lately, after the slim hopes for Abu Mazen's government were dashed, America has become more sharply aware of the gravity of the danger which could soon ruin forever any chance of implementing a "two states for two peoples" solution.

"By 2020," states a recent editorial in The New York Times, "the Jews will be a minority... Talk of two states will end. Two options will remain: an apartheid state ... or a new political entity without a Jewish identity. The conclusion is clear. Israel must begin to plan its exit from the West Bank and Gaza, not only to permit the creation of a viable, contiguous Palestinian state, but to preserve its own future."

As for the United States, the editorial continues, "true support for Israel means helping it see through its pain and rage to its own best interest."

Bill Clinton essentially offered the same dire prognostication in Tel Aviv this week - albeit wrapped in the tender sentiments of "someone who loves Israel more than words can say," but leaving no room for doubt. "Every year," he warned, "the Palestinians grow larger, younger, poorer, angrier." Israel would continue to prevail militarily, he said, "but they will break your heart."

From the waves of admiration that engulf Clinton every time he visits here, one sees the marginality of the impact of those Israeli and American Jewish extremists who attempted to portray the former U.S. president as hostile because of his relentless efforts to redivide this country to accommodate two peoples.

President Bush, with his clear-eyed vision of two states living in peace side by side, would win the sweeping support of his people, of the world - and also of this tormented land - if he would just give the nod to Condoleezza to tell Weisglass to pass the word to Sharon: Get out of the territories.

Refusal for the sake of democracy
By Amos Schocken	| Oct. 2, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Last Independence Day eve, I was invited to a party at the home of some friends. On the program was a private torch-lighting ceremony, scheduled to precede the official ceremony on Mt. Herzl.

One young man called up to light a torch said: "I hereby light this torch on the 55th anniversary of the State of Israel in honor of my peers, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, who bear the burden of defense with devotion and self-sacrifice, and in honor of my peers who refuse to serve in the territories, reminding us, in spite of punishment and social ostracism, that we are fighting not only for the security of our nation but also for the occupation and dispossession of another people seeking, just as we are, to live proudly in a country of its own. And to the glory of the State of Israel."

To ignore this duality in our lives, as the commander of the Israel Air Force has, is to show that one lacks the tools to understand the reality that has long been confronting our soldiers, and especially over the last few years. To respond with panic and aggressiveness to the letter of the 27 pilots, as Major General Dan Halutz has, is to show that one lacks the qualities a commander needs to motivate his soldiers in complex situations.

Dan Halutz has simple solutions for such complexity. "Did the General Staff sit down for any discussion of the moral issues before reaching the unusual decision to target Hamas leader Mahmoud a-Zahr together with his wife and child?" Halutz was asked in an interview with Ma'ariv.

"What do you mean 'child'?" replied Halutz. "We're not talking about a 3-month-old baby. Under the laws of the state of Israel he's an adult, and according to the custom there he was a Hamas member. The bodyguard who was killed was no saint either. The guy was a terrorist."

"But still, the son ultimately paid for his father's sins," the interviewer insisted.

"The son is a member of Hamas just like the father," answered Halutz. "I don't know if he has a card with the most up-to-date picture, but he's a member."

One might ask if the attempt on a-Zahr's life was not in itself an illegal order, but there is no doubt that the air force commander's justification for killing a-Zahr's son is criminal. According to no yardstick did this 24-year-old deserve to die. The question of whether it is legal to kill a bystander while liquidating a "ticking bomb" is a complicated matter, but what happens when the target of assassination is not a ticking bomb. Is it acceptable for flight squadrons to discuss such issues? But how can they not, if they don't want to carry out orders that are blatantly illegal?

The pilots who signed the letter of refusal not only challenged the legality of assassination orders. They also pointed out that the occupation drags Israel into committing illegal acts, and that the occupation itself is illegal. They were immediately accused of being motivated by politics and undermining the foundations of democracy. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz branded it an act of political sensationalism masquerading as morality, and accused the pilots of encouraging the enemy.

It is depressing to see that in today's Israel, the political activism appreciated and encouraged by Mofaz and his ilk is the Uzi Cohen and Shlomi Oz variety, whereas the moment political discourse addresses questions of morality and ideology, the defense minister's reaction is entirely negative.

The truth is, there is nothing wrong with a political stance, and under certain conditions, there is nothing wrong with reaching the personal operative conclusions that emanate from it. On the contrary, people who are prepared to involve themselves in politics in a way that is no longer common in Israel today, i.e., activism that brings with it no monetary reward or promise of power, should be encouraged.

Some argue that refusal to obey military commands for political-ideological reasons undermines the democratic process. It is hard to quarrel with this argument, but I wonder if we would have accepted it in the case of a white South African refusenik during the apartheid era. I tend to think not. I wonder if, in spite of the differences between South African apartheid and our situation, there is not also some similarity.

One country inhabited by two populations - one enjoying all rights and protections, while the other is denied basic rights and is controlled by the first. What could be more undemocratic than that? What democracy are we defending when we denounce those who act, according to their ability and understanding, against such injustice? If the duty of a soldier is to protect democracy, maybe it is these defiant pilots who are the ones protecting Israeli democracy.

The road map is waiting

The ebb and flow of violence has done little to contribute to a sustainable and equitable solution palatable to both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, the situation is deeply unstable and exploitative. The intent of the road map has been abused.

The Palestinians have shown little commitment to protecting Israel's security, nor have the Israelis demonstrated adequate dedication to allowing the peace process to occur. Israeli military incursions have continued, and more curfews have been imposed on Palestinian towns and villages. The death toll on the Palestinian side has risen. Also, the resurgence of heinous attacks by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups has claimed an intolerable toll of innocent Israeli citizens, and torpedoed the efforts of the international community to restore hope and to bring peace, security and stability to the region.

The road map is the best option for both parties for it provides a very clear-cut end game, which ends the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 and establishes a viable, sovereign and independent Palestinian state next to the state of Israel. And, it provides, for the first time, for foreign monitors (from the Quartet) on the ground to watch and vouch whether there is a side that's doing and a side that's not doing. There are 15 clear-cut Palestinian obligations, 12 clear-cut Israeli obligations, and none of them are negotiation-oriented commitments; they are all decision-oriented commitments.

I believe that the international community must take these 27 commitments, benchmark them in terms of time and tell the parties we're watching you. The bloodshed and death toll have reached an unforgivable threshold. Some unruly elements are waging unholy war of mutual ethnic cleansing. Neither the security fence, barriers, targeted assassinations nor home destructions have scaled down the momentum of the intifada, and achieved the peace and security Israel craves, nor have Hamas retaliatory operations brought Palestinians the peace and state they long for.

The time for a dramatic and imperative move to foment a durable and unwavering peace is now. Ordinary people are fed up with articulate and eloquent articles in newspapers calling for a one-state solution or other hypothetical, visionary ideas written for fame and publicity. The road map is awaiting application. The children of Abraham are worthy of a better future.

Applause for the morality of the refusenik pilots

For their refusal to bomb civilian areas, the 27 Israeli pilots are truly not just national but international heroes.I dare say that if any national parliament were to have the moral spirit of those pilots, it would be a brilliant beacon not only in these troubled times but also in the future of humankind.

The pilots have risked both punishment and ostracism in their courageous objection to their country's immoral military strategy, materially and politically supported by the United States. Just as those who give support to al-Quaida are rightly judged by U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft as accessory to terrorist crimes, so is the United States an accessory to the Israeli bombing of civilian areas in Palestine. It is indeed ironic that while Pentagon officials proudly announce that their efforts to avoid collateral bomb damage in Afghanistan reflected traditional American values,they remained mute about their simultaneous furnishing of ordnance used by Israel to bomb civilian areas.

The Israeli pilots have manifested the noblest of human values - compassion. How different is the reaction of U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who appears more humane than his Pentagon counterparts. Still, in all, recently referring to Israeli bombing, Powell objected not to the civilian deaths but merely voiced the pragmatic point that such military action gives rise to more terrorists in the future. Oh the banality of evil! How many have forgotten that it is a monstrosity to torture or recklessly kill even one person on whatever grounds!

If I could meet your 27 pilots, it would be an honor to shake their hands. And I would also tell them how, after the honorable defense by my country of human rights during the Second World War, I became so disillusioned. The historically naive Bush who rants about sending abroad "universal American values" seems to ignore the Vietnamese War; the direct and indirect CIA killings of civilians in Central America; the two dozen American vetoes of proposed United Nations sanctions against the South African apartheid regime; the CIA killing of a duly elected prime minister in Iran in the 1970s and, abominably, so on. The White House doesn't dare mention your heroic airmen - sometimes ideals are frightening.

Why Sharon is dangerous
He doesn't try to keep his promise of peace and his promise of security is worthless. He is a bloody adventurer who scoffs at dangers, even if you pay the price. He revived the incitement against the left over a memorandum of understanding that was drafted together with senior Palestinian figures, and the moves of an especially skilled tactician are especially dangerous.

Why? Because he doesn't even try to keep his promise of peace, and has made his promise of security worthless. Because he is a bloody adventurer who scoffs at dangers, even if you pay the price. Because this week he revived the incitement against the left over a memorandum of understanding that was drafted together with senior Palestinian figures. Because the moves of an especially skilled tactician are especially dangerous.

Plenty of familiar reasons for Sharon being a political ticking bomb spring immediately to mind. Here are several more that occur upon second, and third, thought.

* They believe him: The incredible and dangerous thing is that despite everything, most Israelis still believe him and believe in him. Sharon has honed the art of political deception to such precision that its victims become passive, and even satisfied, observers. This is the Sharon paradox: The situation under his leadership is so terrible that the majority, which yearns for some illusion of an achievement, prefers not to believe that the situation is as abominable as it is.

* The success of failure: This is why Sharon is still able to plant the empty hope that things will get better - if you'll all just wait a little bit, and then some more. Under normal circumstances, this tactic would collapse after three years of such dissonance between hope and despair. But Sharon is very dangerous because of his tremendous ability to get the public, ordinarily known for its cranky skepticism, to suspend its disbelief in direct proportion to the gravity of the national predicament. Paradox number two promises to keep the Sharon danger alive: As the country's plight worsens, Israelis' dependence on a "strongman" who will rescue them from their troubles grows in equal measure - even if the purported savior is largely responsible for getting them into the mess in the first place. Sharon deserves a Nobel Prize for his discovery of "The Success of Failure."

* He has a sense of humor: The aforementioned contradiction also has a comic effect, as if directed by Eli Yatzpan. Abba Eban used to say that Israel is not a banana republic, but a republic that slips on bananas. Sharon manages to make his repeated banana-slipping amusing, while you just keep bruising your backside. He knows how to giggle just like Yatzpan, how to be as amiable as blooper impresario Yigal Shilon. He's even shed his tic. When a dangerous leader also has a sense of humor, it's time to put on the flak jackets.

* The enemy as collaborator: Another dangerous leader who has lost his quiver, Yasser Arafat, is actually an important ally along Sharon's twisted road. From Lebanon until today, Arik has been pursuing Yasser like Sherlock Holmes on the trail of Moriarty. But there is cause to suspect that he is not really interested in Arafat's elimination. If his legendary rival were gone, Sharon would have to invent a new one.

As the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy wrote, in his poem about the distress of Roman senators who sat futilely "Waiting for the Barbarians" (also the name of a book about apartheid by Nobel Prize laureate J. M. Coetzee): "Now what's going to happen to us without the barbarians? These people were a kind of solution." This is another secret of his dangerous politics - perpetuating the enemy in order to justify himself. Just wonder what "difficult time" he could have manipulated between crises without the Palestinian hook on which to hang all of our troubles.

* The return of past glory: Amid the national weakness, Sharon knows how to create distracting images of power, as with the dangerous bombing raid in Syria. He once said that the Israel Defense Forces could even reach Odessa. In dispatching the air force this way, he seems to be practicing for a bombing of the Iranian nuclear reactor. After a month of revisited suffering on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, the Syrian raid was like a promise to a dejected nation that the glory of the Six-Day War, that faded blue-and-white grandeur, would yet return. Take cover.

The bleating of the sheep: Beware of devious leaders who can often be seen gently petting animals. M's adversary in the James Bond films wouldn't have been so menacing without that little kitty in his arms. Sharon soars to the heights of tenderness when with his bleating sheep - on his farm and in the government. Come on, really now, how could such a soft, gentle man be at all dangerous?

People and Politics / What suffering? The fabric of life is not torn
When the Defense Ministry director general, Amos Yaron, the chief executive for the separation fence, is asked to comment on the suffering of the thousands of Palestinians whose lives have been made miserable by the fence, he tells the questioner to ask the people who send the suicide bombers.

When the Defense Ministry director general, Amos Yaron, the chief executive for the separation fence, is asked to comment on the suffering of the thousands of Palestinians whose lives have been made miserable by the fence, he tells the questioner to ask the people who send the suicide bombers.

On the other hand, his boss, Shaul Mofaz, commander in chief of the occupied territories, has never seen a Palestinian who has watched his home being cut off from his fields. The defense minster also has never heard of any Palestinian children needing to ask an Israeli soldier every morning for permission to pass to go to school. Last Friday, Mofaz looked straight into the cameras of Channel Two and said: "I am sure the fence does not harm the Palestinian fabric of life."

Apparently there's a plot by the director general, chief of staff, the major general of the IDF Central Command, and the government coordinator in the territories to hide the difficult conditions of the defense minister's subjects from him. As a service to Mofaz, here is a summary of some incidents that about the routine of the "Palestinian fabric of life." The stories are also evidence of a wide range of areas where the army could actually implement a policy of easing humanitarian conditions.

Last Wednesday, a Civil Administration car pulled into the little village of Aqaba, in the Jenin district, not far from the village of Tiasser. Aqaba, which is entirely in Area C, meaning fully under Israeli control and responsibility, consists of about 200 people living in 18 modest homes.

An army officer, accompanied by a group of soldiers and an IDF cameraman, went from house to house in the village and handed out a dozen demolition orders. The village head, Haj Sami Sadak, received a demolition order for the mosque and the kindergarten, where more than 40 of the village children go to school. "Where will we pray?" asked Sadak.

"Go to Tobas," said the officer. Before leaving behind a group of hardworking poor people whose entire world had just been ruined, the officer said they had three days to appeal the orders in the Beit El headquarters. "But all the roads are closed by checkpoints," the villagers pointed out. "That's your problem," said the officer.

Adam Keller, from Gush Shalom, has long followed the "fabric of life" in the village of Aqaba - many of the villagers are third and fourth generation - says the residents don't stop trying to get permission for building licenses and pubic buildings for their village. All the requests are rejected. Keller sent Mofaz a request to set aside the demolition decrees, which practically speaking means erasing the village off the face of the earth. It's not known whether that surprised Mofaz or kept him awake at night,

Unfortunately for the villagers of Aqaba, when their grandparents and great grandparents built their homes they did not take into account that their choice of location would obstruct the eastern fence that the Israeli defense minister insists on building as soon as possible.

According to Mofaz's route, the fence would split Aqaba, cutting it off from Tiasser, it's mother-village and then head south to Ma'ale Ephraim, the Israeli settlement. It's the destruction of a dozen homes, a kindergarten and a mosque. Isn't that "harm to the Palestinian fabric of life?"

The dwindling public coffers are not in Mofaz's way. Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, competing with Mofaz for Sharon's seat, won't dare do anything against such a popular plan. The only obstacle is the prime minister. Not that Sharon, the man who came up with the idea of Bantustine, is deterred by the idea of putting the Palestinians into corrals. After all, he's had the plan for years. But he prefers to wait for an opportunity to fulfill his vision without harming his fabric of relations with U.S. President George Bush.

It turns out that in Washington they found out the map of the Palestinian state recently published by Yuli Tamir MK was drafted on the basis of solid information that reached her from inside the defense establishment. The Americans warned Dov Weisglass, Sharon's lawyer-advisor, there there's a limit to their ability to defend something bordering on apartheid.

According to the Sharon-Mofaz plan, the 200 people of Aqaba are only a small minority of the 237,000 West Bankers who will find themselves outside the fence of the Palestinian "state," which will be no larger than 3,600 square kilometers.

A spokesman for the government coordinator in the territories said the demolition orders had nothing to do with the fence. They were against buildings that did not have proper licenses.

Torn fabric

Here's another story about Palestinians whose fabric of life has not been harmed by the fence, according to Mofaz. It's in a statement that attorney Shlomo Laker plans to present to the High Court as part of a petition, and which was sent to the legal advisor of the Judea and Samaria Command. It's a story about 77 men and women and 120 children, who live on the edges of A Tur, at the Mount of Olives, on the Jerusalem border.

The adults in the neighborhood have been living there since the mid-1950s. Two of the residential buildings in the neighborhood are inside the municipal area of the Israeli capital and their residents pay city taxes. The rest mostly work in Jerusalem, use its clinics and hospitals and attend educational institutions in the city's east.

Last month, when construction of the eastern part of the "Jerusalem envelope" began, the people of the neighborhood found themselves between the city boundary and the fence. Going west, into East Jerusalem was prohibited to them since they are considered residents of the West Bank. But moving east, to the West Bank, turned into a complicated project. An A Tur resident coming home from Bethlehem where they visited parents has to present an Israeli ID card or a permit to enter the country.

Sometimes, begging and pleading and explanations work, sometimes the A Tur person doesn't have all the papers demanded by the soldiers and police, and they are forced to stay outside the fence.

Border Patrol, who cover the the slopes of the Mt. of Olives, are somewhat confused between the fence and the municipal border. According to Laker, police have arrested residents of the village outside their homes on suspicion of being in the country illegally, even though they were not actually in the country, since their homes are outside Jerusalem's boundaries. A few have been taken back to the Bethlehem checkpoint and told never to return.

How will the legal advisors of the defense establishment deal with people who have become prisoners in their own homes and illegally on their land? Will they accede to the A Tur request to give them permanent passes to Jerusalem? Will they instruct the soldiers responsible for the fence to allow the people of A Tur to get home safely? Or if all that would be considered too soft on them, maybe they'll offer alternative land outside the fence, or even financial compensation?

No less interesting is how the High Court will deal with petitions from Palestinians across the West Bank and Jerusalem who demand the Israeli authorities allow them to go from place to place on their own land. One can also wonder if the justices will agree with the defense minister that there has been no harm done to the Palestinian fabric of life.

For peace

Mofaz's office said the reports yesterday on Israel Radio about turning illegal outposts into permanent settlements was inaccurate. It was only granting permission to eight outposts to install generators and the rest the items needed for the "security composite." All the outposts are in various stages of getting permits for permanent settlement. Until then the IDF must provide the residents with security.

Dozens of other illegal outposts, still under "examination" in the ministry, as well as those that were dismantled and then resurrected, are already getting a substantial portion of security allocations in the territories.

It turns out that since the the government decided to protect the criminals instead of arresting them and demolishing their homes, the army doesn't have enough forces to protect "legal" settlers and protect the "kosher" settlements. On the other hand, when the poor residents of Aqaba get fed up with running around for naught between the various administration offices and dare build a kindergarten without a license, the army is in a hurry to issue demolition orders.

The same authorities are responsible for the security of law-abiding Palestinians. But they are responsible for the criminals from the illegal outposts in the Eli and Yitzhar areas south of Nablus knew they could invade the olive groves of Al Sawaya and Inabus, two nearby villages, since the complaints filed with the authorities by those farmers in the past never went anywhere.

This time the criminals were not satisfied by stealing the olives ready for harvest. The villagers heard the sound of the chain-saws during the night and in the morning found 300 cut-down trees on their land. Like Mofaz and Sharon, the thugs acting in the name of Torah and the government of Israel are not bothered by the fabric of life of their neighbors.

A delegation from Gush Shalom and Rabbis for Human Rights, who went to the village of Inabus in solidarity with the villagers, were attacked by a gang of settlers. A British reporter covering the event was injured and taken to hospital.

The outpost partying might come to an end soon. In contacts with Shimon Peres, it turns out Ahmed Qureia will retract his resignation next week, in a compromise with Arafat that gives Qureia the interior ministry with Jibril Rajoub as deputy in the West Bank and one of Mohammed Dahlan's people as deputy for Gaza. Qureia will make some moves evidence of his intent to follow the road map. A prevailing view in the political establishment is that pressure from elements in the defense establishment who have reached the conclusion that the IDF cannot be victorious over the Palestinians, and the Geneva understandings document will combine to force Sharon to do something too, for peace.

The basis could be the Peres-Abu Ala plan, from 2001, when there was a unity government. After all, everyone involved then is in the picture - Sharon, Peres, Bush and Qureia. Sharon can assume that if the move leaves the ministerial patrons for the outposts outside the government, he can always find the good old Labor Party leader.

Still not bridging the gap
The Foreign Ministry is treating the visit of the 150 lawmakers - who represent the 15 EU countries, the 10 new members and the European Parliament - with the "appropriate excitement," as one senior official phrased it. "It is an impressive mass. There has never been a visit here of such a large multinational delegation of MPs.

AMMAN - Irish Senator David Norris, who walked into the lobby of the Marriott Hotel in Amman, appeared perturbed. Norris, a member of the Irish parliament's foreign affairs committee, had just attended a lecture in the hotel for the delegation of 150 parliamentarians from Europe of which he is a member. The lecturer attacked Yasser Arafat. Norris was shocked. He declared heatedly that this was a public relations campaign and he would not allow the organizers to pull the wool over his eyes. A few hours earlier, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom sounded most satisfied. "The upcoming visit of the delegation to Israel is another step in strengthening ties with Europe, to which I am devoting most of my time," he said in a telephone conversation. "The fact that a delegation like this has chosen to boycott Arafat during its visit is an indication that there has been some movement on the part of the Europeans lately," he added.

The Foreign Ministry is treating the visit of the 150 lawmakers - who represent the 15 EU countries, the 10 new members and the European Parliament - with the "appropriate excitement," as one senior official phrased it. "It is an impressive mass. There has never been a visit here of such a large multinational delegation of MPs. Some 70 percent have never been to Israel before and if they are able to see the reality from close up, it is possible that they will refrain from reciting the official positions of their countries," he said.

A conversation with Francois Leotard, a former French defense minister who is one of the heads of Med-Bridge, the strategic center that initiated the visit, throws some light on what Senator Norris was getting at. The average profile of the lawmakers in the delegation, so it seems, is not exactly that of someone who "recites his government's official positions."

The declared purpose of the organizers of the visit is to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East and to shatter preconceived ideas. But Leotard, free of any diplomatic formalism, admits that, "at least from my point of view," this is a solidarity visit with Israel.

While the EU considers Arafat the elected leader of the Palestinian people, a leader with whom a dialogue is unavoidable, Leotard places sole responsibility for the failure of the Oslo process on Arafat, talks of the rampant corruption in the PA and calls for the establishment of a new reservoir of Palestinian leaders over whom the mythological "rais" will no longer hold sway.

At a time when the media in Europe widely describe the separation fence between Israel and the Palestinians as a "political wall" or an "apartheid wall aimed at assisting the burgeoning policy of preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state," Leotard is careful to use the Israeli terminology, "barriere" in French, and not "mur" or wall, he stresses. He won't swallow stories. "Those very European leaders who attack the barrier would erect one themselves if they were in the place of the Israeli prime minister who has to contend with horrific terrorist attacks," he says.

Leotard also has much to say about the French anti-Israel policy "to which all the French governments since 1967, right or left, adhered." In the same way that France erred when it attacked Israel for bombing the Iraqi reactor in 1981, so it has erred recently by attacking it for bombing a terrorist base in Syria. In view of this policy, do you wonder that [French President Jacques] Chirac is perceived as being anti-Semitic in Israel even though there is no basis to this?" he asks.

Leotard says of himself that he grew up on the Bible. Phrases like "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem" are locked in his heart. His strong sympathy for Israel also stems from the Holocaust. In his opinion, the Europeans have no right to preach. They should rather study their own history and look in the mirror. Asked whether he accepts the common wisdom in Europe that the recent attack on a military base at a settlement is a legitimate act on the part of an occupied people, he seems to take an even more rightist tack than Prime Minister Sharon: "I don't use those terms. The most serious oppressor of the Palestinian people was the Arab world itself."

Not all the lawmakers share Leotard's "Zionist fervor." The delegation also included critical politicians, but these appear to have been swallowed up in the waves of sympathy and understanding toward the Israeli government's policy.

During the interview, Shalom spoke of European leaders who had admitted to him that even today one photo-op with Arafat was enough to put up their popularity ratings. This was an indication of the gap that exists between most of the delegation members, and the decision-makers and the man-on-the-street in Europe. Despite the unprecedented information campaign to which the Foreign Ministry was a party, it is hard to imagine that the visit of those already convinced will be able to bridge this gap.

S. Africa eyed Israeli missiles in 1975
South Africa's apartheid government considered buying Jericho surface-to-surface missiles from Israel in 1975 with the intent of equipping them with nuclear warheads, according to a paper recently declassified by the South African defense ministry.

South Africa's apartheid government considered buying Jericho surface-to-surface missiles from Israel in 1975 with the intent of equipping them with nuclear warheads, according to a paper recently declassified by the South African defense ministry.

The document, which was sent in March 1975 to the then-chief of staff of the South African army, Admiral Hugo Biermann, recommended purchasing the Jericho missiles to provide South Africa with a nuclear deterrent. The authors apparently believed the country was susceptible to nuclear threats from terrorist organizations or African countries that might acquire tactical nuclear weapons.

Though the Jericho is an Israeli missile, Israel's name is not mentioned in the document: The authors merely reported that, according to "the supplier," the missile was accurate enough to hit a target 500 kilometers away with an error of no more than 500 meters. "The accuracy indicated by the supplier is acceptable if the missile is armed with a nuclear warhead," the document said. The authors then recommended that South Africa either develop its own nuclear weapons or purchase them elsewhere. A map showed where the missile could reach within each of South Africa's neighbors.

As far as is known, South Africa never purchased Jericho missiles. It did, however, develop nuclear weapons - a fact discovered only when the program was discontinued in 1991, in the last days of the apartheid regime.

The document was made public by the University of Witwatersrand, whose researchers have submitted many requests to have documents declassified under the Freedom of Information Act. At first, these requests were refused on the grounds that all documents relating to South Africa's nuclear program had been destroyed. But to the researchers' surprise, the defense ministry later sent them the document on the Jericho missiles.

Asked to comment on the document, Dr. Avner Cohen, a historian at the University of Maryland who researches the history of Israel's nuclear program, said that, "whatever commitments South Africa had given to Israel regarding protecting its secrets, this disclosure highlights the simple fact that, in the world of today, it is very hard to keep secrets indefinitely, especially when other countries are involved. Policy-makers should consider present secrets as open for the historian of the future."

Defense cooperation between Israel and South Africa increased greatly after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when both countries were suffering from international isolation. Then-defense minister Shimon Peres pushed for increasing Israeli defense exports to the apartheid regime, and in the ensuing years, Pretoria became the leading client of Israel's defense industries.

Defensive walls of self-righteousness
The delusions, the self-righteousness, and the disassociation from a hostile world and the distancing from universal norms are symptoms of a society sinking into apartheid, as the South Africans who experienced that descent can attest.
By Meron Benvenisti	| Nov. 6, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
For anyone who returned from Europe after a planned or chance human, social or business encounter, there was nothing new in the publication of the survey denouncing Israel as "the most dangerous to world peace." The harsh criticism of Israel and her actions, which deviate from universal norms, descended to the point of personal revulsion and even fundamental delegitimization as expressed in the blunt statement, written by an American intellectual, "Israel, in short, is an anachronism."

International legitimacy is an essential factor in the ethno-national conflict, which involves deep ideologies and emotions, and it is greatly troubling that this legitimacy is being undermined, and so attempts are being made to remove it through various means.

Everyone hastened to brush off the survey, to downplay its value, to question the credibility of the statistics, to express their indignation at the sloppiness of the wording of the questions and Israel's very inclusion in it. But there was no doubt that the survey reflects the mood of broad public opinion, and this time it is impossible to focus the blame on cynical leaders like the president of France, who for practical reasons makes no protest against anti-Semitic comments. This time it was the voice of the masses.

Just as there was nothing new in the findings of the survey, there was nothing new in Israel's reaction to its publication. "That's Europe, with its anti-Semitism," said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "Our anger is not toward Europe's citizens, but toward the governments," said the Foreign Ministry trying to direct the blame.

The public is incited by anti-Semitic governments, opines a perplexed establishment, which is under attack for its failure in explaining Israel's position and for disseminating "banal messages in poor English," causing Israel to lose the battle of public opinion.

The blame will always fall on the messenger, and never on the instigators and perpetrators of evil deeds. It is inevitable; Israel's actions, her image and her very existence will always be examined via the prism of thousands of years of intimate interaction between the Jewish people and its Christian persecutors in Europe.

This deep fallout also sharpens the European public's reactions to the daily images of the underdog who became the oppressor, as well as influences the special care with which European governments handle matters connected with Israel, and enables Israelis to activate their ancient defense mechanism, which turns any criticism or censure into an expression of anti-Semitism. The ability to rely on this defense mechanism enables Israelis to construct high defensive walls of self-righteousness, arrogance and pan-Jewish tribal rallying, separating themselves from the universal tenets that apply to the rest of the world.

The perception that through Jewish suffering and sacrifices, Israel acquired the right to define for herself and others the values regarding what is acceptable considering the threat to her existence, blurs the constant slide down the slope of evil. This self-defense mechanism increases the ability to relate to events separately from one another, without discerning the connection and the context that makes them into a whole picture.

There is seemingly no connection between the separation fence and the Shin Bet security services' supervision of the granting of press credentials, or the tempestuous reactions against the "Geneva Understandings" and the feeble reaction to the uprooting of olive trees belonging to Palestinians.

But all these events and many others (whose frequency has made them commonplace) combine to become one picture: Israel has acquired the status of a pariah state, whose definition as an apartheid state is not determined as such only because all concerned - and for contradictory reasons - insist on referring to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as "the occupied territories."

They thereby make it possible to adhere to the fallacy that the root of the evil is not in the ethno-national control of the Jewish collective, but rather temporary "military occupation," which is due to end in "withdrawal." This fallacy is supported by another, called "the Palestinian Authority," whose very existence is based on the need to present a state-like "external body," that externalizes the "Palestinian problem" and hints at "separation - we are here and they are there," which sort of makes Israel "democratic and Jewish" (or the opposite).

Even if this separation is not implemented - and in the meantime the apartheid wall, in the form of the "separation fence," continues to be built - it is not enough to dispel the delusion of many that "we are okay," albeit there are "some demographic problems in the future." The dangers are always relegated to "the future," and are never in the present.

The delusions, the self-righteousness, and the disassociation from a hostile world and the distancing from universal norms are symptoms of a society sinking into apartheid, as the South Africans who experienced that descent can attest.

The hiding behind anti-Semitism may make an impression on the Europeans, but it will not be long before the ostracism will penetrate the walls of self-righteousness and bring them crashing down.

Yes: Jewish and democratic
"Yisrael Umishpakhat Haamim: Medinat Le'om Yehudit Uzekhuyot Haadam" ("Israel and the Family of Nations: Jewish Nation-State and Human Rights) by Alexander Yakobson and Amnon Rubinstein, Schocken, 476 pages, NIS 95.

"Yisrael Umishpakhat Haamim: Medinat Le'om Yehudit Uzekhuyot Haadam" ("Israel and the Family of Nations: Jewish Nation-State and Human Rights) by Alexander Yakobson and Amnon Rubinstein, Schocken, 476 pages, NIS 95

This book is like a breath of fresh air to all those interested in the image of Israel as a nation-state and in the issue of its Jewish and democratic character. For the most part this debate takes place in the shallow Israeli swamp, as if no other country or nation on earth is tackling similar questions. Isaiah Berlin once quipped that "Jews are like everybody else, only more so." Yakobson and Rubinstein restore the debate on Israel's image to its proper historical and comparative dimensions. Even those who may dispute the authors' position cannot ignore the book itself - the multidimensional nature of its arguments and the wealth of documentation, constitutional and historical, that it contains.

Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, who needs no introduction as a public figure or as the author of one of the basic books on constitutional law in Israel, has collaborated in "Israel and the Family of Nations: Jewish Nation-State and Human Rights" with historian Dr. Alexander Yakobson, who contributes to this book its historical dimension. Together they present, in a sharply focused manner (albeit with doubts and reservations), the book's central thesis: Yes, the State of Israel is - and was intended to be, in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution of 1947 - a Jewish and democratic state, and these two components do not contradict one another.

The first part of "Israel and the Family of Nations" deals with an issue that is not widely discussed in Israel: the international context of Israel's creation and the debates in the UN General Assembly on the partition of Palestine. There might be those who will say that this first section is superfluous; however, the authors are justified in their perception of that chapter in history as a vital element in the current debate. Because of disputes that later emerged with the UN and because of its development in the direction of hostility toward Israel, there is a tendency in Israel to adopt a disparaging attitude toward that international body. Nonetheless, the cold hard fact is that the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state derives its international legitimacy from the UN's decisions. The Arab states, which have gone to war not only against Israel, but also against the UN's resolutions, naturally tend to ignore this aspect and to portray Israel - not just from 1967 onward, but from its very creation in 1948 - as an imperialist occupying power.

Even those who call themselves post-Zionists find it very convenient to ignore the fact that, were it not for the granting of this international legitimacy based on universal values, Israel would never have been created. One individual who clearly perceived this point was the founder of modern political Zionism, Theodor Herzl. Thus the preamble to the Basel Program called for the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish state "recognized by international law." Moreover, the authors of this book correctly discern that those who claim that Israel cannot be both Jewish and democratic are, in effect, undermining Israel's very legitimacy - although, for various reasons, some of them tactical, the individuals making this claim prefer not to say so openly.

Legitimate aspirations

Yakobson and Rubinstein have conducted a comprehensive study of the debates on the partition of Palestine in UN committees and in the General Assembly. The following points in this study should be mentioned here. The UN's debates and resolutions regarding the partition of Palestine explicitly referred to the creation of two states - one Jewish, the other Arab - as an expression of the legitimate national aspirations of both the Jews and the Arabs. The UN explicitly recognized that one of the goals of the Jewish state would be massive Jewish immigration into its territory, and saw nothing wrong in the principle of what was formulated later as Israel's Law of Return. Quite the contrary: The UN recognized that the Jewish state would be not just a state representing its Jewish (and Arab) citizens, but that the Jewish state's legitimate justification would be that it would be open to Jewish immigration. For that reason, the sparsely populated Negev was included within the boundaries of the envisaged Jewish state.

The UN anticipated that the two states would establish democratic regimes and that the Jewish state would safeguard the rights of the Arab minority. In accordance with all the accepted norms, the UN saw no built-in contradiction in Israel's being a Jewish and a democratic state. Nevertheless, the authors repeatedly point out that the Arab opposition to the creation of a Jewish state was at the time - as it is, in effect, today - the refusal of Arab nationalism to recognize the existence of a Jewish state. Since the regimes of all the Arab states in 1947 were conservative, one cannot help but smile when reading the words of Syria's UN representative, whose doomsday prediction was the flooding of Palestine with communist masses. The Arabs then accused Zionism of having strong links with communism; today they accuse it of having strong links with colonialism. What has not changed is the refusal to recognize the existence of a Jewish people that deserves the right to self-determination. (On this issue, the authors extensively discuss the contradictory nature of the positions held by intellectuals such as Edward Said and MK Azmi Bishara, who recognize the Arab right to self- determination, but deny that same right to the Jews.)

The authors also note that the attribution of a colonialist character to Israel makes no sense because colonialism is based on the existence of a mother country that, using its military or economic might, sets up and reinforces colonies. That kind of situation obviously did not exist in the history of Zionism. Regarding the argument that Zionism received the assistance of the world powers - that statement is true, of course. However, it should also be recalled that all small nations that have attained independence received the support of the world's powers - for example, Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania - and that Poland and Czechoslovakia attained statehood following World War I thanks to the assistance of the world's powers. Albanian Kosovo will eventually become independent due to the military intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It should also be recalled that the Arab Revolt during World War I was the fruit of the efforts of British intelligence in Cairo, efforts that were spearheaded by Lawrence of Arabia.

`Diaspora nationalism'

The fact that Jewish nationalism was once a "Diaspora nationalism" is not unique; Greek and Armenian nationalisms were also "diaspora nationalisms," although obviously, one can speak here of only a similarity, not an identity. However, the book primarily deals with the tension between Israel's character as a Jewish state and its democratic values. A central point in the authors' arguments is that those who compare Israel to the United States - a comparison that is favored even by Israel's extreme left - are mistaken: Israel should be compared to modern nation-states, for the most part, the European ones. And, when that comparison is made, three issues emerge.

First, nearly all the world's nation-states have national minorities and, in these countries, the state's public character - as expressed in its emblem, flag and anthem - has been determined by the majority's cultural heritage. Second, in democratic nation-states with an expatriate diaspora, the members of that diaspora have a right of return that is similar to the one articulated in Israel's Law of Return. Third, in some of the leading Western democracies, special status is accorded to the religion that is historically identified with that country's national heritage.

Before we discuss in detail the significance of this comparative dimension, we should mention some of the authors' critical positions toward the Jewish religious nationalist right in Israel. First of all, the authors unequivocally state that the idea of Israel being both Jewish and democratic is not a contradiction in terms - but only if the concept "Jewish" is interpreted in its national, not religious, context. If the intention is to turn Israel into a country whose laws are those of the Jewish religion (that is, a Jewish theocracy), obviously Israel cannot be, at the same time, a democracy. They illustrate this point effectively by pointing out that, just as the accepted day of rest in Western countries is Sunday, whose roots, but not its contents, are religious (there is no obligation to attend church services, and so forth), similarly it is natural that the official day of rest in Israel is Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, although the state does not determine its contents.

The authors also state that religion does not determine the boundaries of the national collective, as has been proved by the country's Russian immigrants and by the extension of the application of Israel's Law of Return. Second, the authors are clearly troubled by Zionism's expropriation by the Zionist-religious right. This is a historical aberration because Zionism started out - despite its respect for Judaism as part of the Jewish people's national-cultural heritage - as a national, not a religious, movement. The authors are also aware of the damage that this expropriation is inflicting on both Zionism and Israel: The identification that is being made by the settlers - and by ideologists such as Yoram Hazony - between Zionism and the settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip have blurred Zionism's historical character and have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of Israel's opponents, who point to the settlers as proof that Zionism is a form of colonial occupation.

The Arab minority

The authors repeatedly warn that the continuation of the Israeli occupation will create an apartheid-like situation. In their view, only the principle of "two states for two nations" is congruent with the universal principles of the Zionist movement in its early stages. The appendices contain fascinating material. Here are a few examples: The Irish constitution contains the phrase "in the Name of the Most Holy Trinity from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and states must be referred," and states its relevance for the Irish diaspora throughout the world. The Greek constitution of 1975, which was passed with the consent of the socialist PASOK party and which also bases itself on the Holy Trinity, establishes the status of the Greek Orthodox Church as the leading church in Greece, clarifies the link between the state and the expatriate Greek diaspora, and emphasizes that diaspora's commitment to help the state in the educational field.

In the Danish and Norwegian constitutions, the Lutheran Church is recognized as the state's official church. In Great Britain, in the absence of a constitution, the status of the Anglican Church, or Church of England, and the Church of Scotland, is ensured as the state church of England and Scotland respectively. Likewise, the authors stress that arrangements somewhat similar to Israel's Law of Return exist in Finland, Ireland and Greece, as well as in Eastern Europe's new democracies - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - and that no international agency (such as the UN, the Council of Europe or the European Union) has found any fault in such arrangements. Opposition to the Israeli Law of Return has nothing to do with universal or humanist concerns; it is simply a basic opposition to the existence of a Jewish state.

In the book's final section, the authors discuss the status of Israel's Arab minority. Obviously, the situation is far from perfect and the authors are especially sensitive to the gap between legal norms and the day-to-day social reality. Nonetheless, they stress - and justifiably so - that Arabic's status as Israel's second official language and the right enjoyed by all of Israel's Arab citizens to an education in their own language place Israel on the road toward multiculturalism far in advance of what is the accepted practice in most democratic countries. Had Israel emulated republican France, for example, in its perception of citizenship as an entity devoid of national, cultural and historical aspects, there would, of course, be no Arab-language schools in Israel today and Israel's Arab citizens would be forced to attend schools where the language of instruction was Hebrew, in accordance with the Jacobin principle of a "single, indivisible republic."

Yakobson and Rubinstein applaud those court rulings in Israel (such as in the Katzir case) that have removed some of the discriminatory practices that still exist in Israeli society and which are aimed at the country's Arab community. Readers interested in studying these issues more extensively and in the ongoing debate the authors, as they study their texts under the microscope, are engaged in with scholars such as Baruch Kimmerling and Sammy Smooha, should read those sections carefully. They will then realize that there is more than one option available as far as the treatment of national minorities is concerned. Even those who disagree with the authors' position will be forced to admit that it is an irrefutable fact that the situation of Israel's Arab minority is at least partially attributable to the Arab-Israeli dispute. It is hard to think of many examples of a democratic country with a national minority that identifies with a nation that is at war with that country.

It is very convenient to compare the situation of Israel's Arab minority to what was experienced by American citizens of Japanese origin during the World War II. The treatment of Japanese-Americans is a blot on American democracy, just as slavery's existence in the U.S., 90 years after the Declaration of Independence, whose preamble states, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal," is a blot that remains on American history to this very day. However, no one would ever argue that such blots - and Israeli history has a considerable number of them, of which the authors are well aware - would lead anyone to question the legitimacy of America's existence. When one takes into consideration the fact that Arab members of Knesset sometimes openly express doubts as to Israel's legitimacy and articulate themselves in ways that some members of the Israeli majority consider to be tantamount to support for terrorist acts against Israeli nationals, it is obvious that here is a heavy burden that few democracies have ever been forced to contend with.

One of the cruel paradoxes of Israeli political life stems from the fact that the stunning achievements of the Six-Day War of June 1967 ironically contained, dialectically speaking, the possibility of challenging Israel's very legitimacy because of the continuation of the Israeli occupation and because of the continued oppression of the Palestinian population. It was the settlers and their backers who undermined, with a considerable degree of success, the extensive international support that Israel enjoyed and which stemmed from the finest traditions of liberal and democratic thought. To ensure that Zionism will continue to be part of those traditions, Israel must free itself of that occupation - even if only unilaterally - as quickly as possible. This is the message that emerges from this book.

If the occupation is not ended, it is doubtful whether a book along the lines of this one can be written 10 years from now. History has already seen revolutions that have liberated the masses and which have then deteriorated. The author's articulate defense of both Zionism and Israel is a warning of what might happen in the future.

People and Politics / Word launderers and peace wanderers
Only a handful of people showed up to hear a discussion about the Geneva Accord last Friday at Beit Berl, which was sponsored by the Katzenelson Foundation.

Only a handful of people showed up to hear a discussion about the Geneva Accord last Friday at Beit Berl, which was sponsored by the Katzenelson Foundation. The audience was mostly interested in hearing from Labor Party Secretary General MK Ophir Pines-Paz, MK Matan Vilnai, and Dr. Zvia Walden, daughter of Shimon Peres, about what they are doing to stop the infighting in the Labor Party and how they intend to get the party back into power.

The reports by two retired army officers, Maj. Gen. Gideon Sheffer and Col. Shaul Arielli, who were part of Yossi Beilin's negotiating team, received restrained, almost neutral responses, as if the talks were academic in nature. Nobody asked Sheffer for further details about a special project he headed as the acting chairman of the National Security Council during Ehud Barak's short-lived administration.

Sheffer revealed that a group of security experts, Foreign Ministry officials and academics were brought together to formulate a document that would describe the desired outcome of successful negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Sheffer said the document they produced was "nearly identical" to the Geneva Accords.

Barak was shown the document in the winter of 2000. It drew very similar borders to the ones in the Geneva document, and in the secret paper, dubbed "the day after plan," the idea of trading territory and a solution to the refugee problem also appears. Jerusalem, under Barak's orders, remained outside the document, which Barak shelved in his office safe without bringing it to any official forum for discussion.

That story didn't change Vilnai's mind about Geneva. A former member of the first Sharon government, and a competitor to Avraham Burg, one of Geneva's signatories, for the party leadership, said Geneva proves there's someone to talk to. But he hurried to add, "Those people don't represent Palestinian society." He said, "We brought Arafat here too soon," and "Oslo never reached the people's hearts." He claimed Sharon conquered the center of the political map and shoved Labor leftward. "The route to the heart of the people and from there to government is through the center, not Geneva," he said. Clearly he meant the Geneva people are driving Labor leftward.

Paz said that while he might not be ready to sign onto every word in Geneva, the document is "incontrovertible evidence that there is no greater lie than there's nobody to talk to on the Palestinian side."

"It's the Israeli government that does not want to talk," said Labor's secretary-general, adding, "The extremist composition of the Likud faction does not allow Sharon to make any painful concessions," so "all the talk about such concessions is deceiving the public."

Geneva versus People's Voice

Two grassroots peace movements are campaigning now in the Israeli and Palestinian society. Each has a platform proposal for a final peace settlement, slogans, public figures, donors and philanthropists. The "People's Voice" group, headed by former Shin Bet chief Ami Ayalon and the president of Al-Quds University, Prof. Sari Nusseibeh, have reached a truce with the Geneva Accord people, led by Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo.

Ayalon and Nusseibeh decided to campaign at the popular level and from there go to the politicians. They'll start meeting with the politicians soon, including representatives from all the parties, without skipping over Shas and United Torah Judaism.

Beilin and Abed Rabbo are politicians, bringing ministers and parliamentarians and they now plan to go to every household in Israel. Some 1.9 million copies of the Geneva Accord are ready to be sent to each one.

A conversation with Col.Issa Abu Aram, chief of operations in the West Bank Preventive Security forces shows that even the senior signatories to the peace initiatives, are not immune from misconceptions. Aram, 43, has a masters degree in environmental studies, and mistakenly believes that the Geneva agreement leaves Ariel in Israeli hands and the right of return in Palestinian hands. He mistakenly believes the Ayalon-Nusseibeh agreement gives the Palestinians sovereignty over Haram el Sharif - the Temple Mount. Aram's comments are indicative of the competition for the hearts and minds of both peoples by both initiatives over whose peace bride is prettier.

According to Aram, Geneva "is an agreement by elites who are used to imposing their agreements on the people." He says, "The people will reject Geneva because it is not suitable to their positions. Geneva will lead to a state that is not viable, because it leaves the settlements in the heart of the territories, like Ariel, Ma'ale Adumim, and Gush Etzion. Geneva gives the Israelis three early warning stations in the territories, the right to freely fly over the Palestinian territory, and control over the electro-magnetic frequencies." Aram explains that Geneva will perpetuate Israeli control over the territories.

But, he says, People's Voice is much closer to fulfillment of the Palestinian dream. It has a firmer populist base and is aimed at forcing the elites on both sides to reach an agreement. According to Aram, "Geneva was formulated with a weak Israeli partner, the left. People's Voice was formulated with an Israeli side that also represents the right flank. Our duty is to create a change in the Palestinian community and crack the wall the Sharon government put up around the Israeli public. By ending the violence and advancing a solution to the conflict, we can win broad popular support. That's the only way to force Sharon to take into consideration the will of both peoples, who have been hurt by the occupation in the economy, social, physical and moral dimension, and must see peace as a common interest."

Laundering words

The separation fence has created a new line in the industrial word laundries of the occupation. The Israel Defense Forces, for example, makes sure to refer to the walls and barbed wire fences with the "clean" term, "seam area." That sounds a lot better than concrete and fences that prevent children from getting to school or old ladies going to a clinic or hospital.

The limitations on movement inside the "seam area" now contributes to an even more problematic new term: "types of people." Meretz MK Zahava Gal-On found the term in the articles of "an order regarding security regulations, for admission to the seam area and presence in it."

Since it is not nice to say that a specific area inside Palestinian territory is only accessible to Israelis and those the Israelis allow into the zone, the order issued by Maj. Gen. Moshe Kaplinski, commanding general of the Central Command, says "this hereby grants entry to the seam area, as defined by the declaration, and allows presence in it, to any person who is among the type of person detailed in the appendix to this permit."

The person who authored the language of "type of person" deserves a medal for word laundering. The document then goes on to list three types of people - those with foreign passports and permits, people with permits to work in Israeli communities, people with a permit to leave the area.

Gal-On wrote to Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz that the document is proof of indifference to morality and values, and that only in dark regimes that no longer exist, like Apartheid South Africa, were people categorized according to "type."

Another order issued by Kaplinski, expropriating a 47-60 meter wide stretch of land for the fence, declaring it "a closed military area" starred at weekend demonstrations against the fence that took place Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Suwahara, where the fence will divide about 20,000 residents from another 10,000 residents of the same community, placing the cemetery, for example, on one side of the fence, inaccessible to the other side.

"It's not a fence to separate Israelis from Palestinians, it's a fence to separate Palestinians from Palestinians," said Osama Zahalka. At the Tel Aviv demonstration, held at the Cinematheque plaza - and like the other rallies, downplayed in the Israeli press - maps were handed out showing what the fence would do if it ran down the length of Ibn Gvirol Boulevard. In Suwahara, about a thousand peace demonstrators, including many Israelis and foreigners, painted anti-war and pro-peace slogans on the wall. A group from Japan, led by a Buddhist priest, painted the word peace in Japanese 50 times on the fence. In the coming days, similar demonstrations will be held in the U.S., England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Australia, South Africa, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Bangladesh and Jordan.

What investigation?

Ever since the olive harvest began, David Nir from Ta'ayush has shown up practically every day in the olive groves of the little village of al Sawaya, surrounded by the outposts put up around the settlement of Eli. Nir also heard the weekend radio report about how Prime Minister Sharon was shocked by the TV images of uprooted and chopped down olive trees and gave an "order" to investigate.

On Sunday, Nir showed up at the grove, with a dozen other human rights activists, to find what remained of Ibrahim el Halil's olive trees in al Sawaya. Apparently, the prime minister's "shock" and "order" for a police probe did not make much of an impression on the thugs on the hills, nor on the Israeli security services.

According to Halil, a few minutes before the Israeli human rights activists showed up, a settler stopped his car beside two elderly women harvesters, one 70 and the other in her 80s, and ran them off. He took their buckets of olives, got in his van and drove off. Four or five settlers picked olives from a grove owned by villagers near the settlement. When they noticed the human rights activists, the settlers ran off, leaving behind tools and a bit of food. Nir says he reported this to the policeman who has been the liaison to the human rights groups since the harvest began, and the police showed up with other Binyamin sub-district police. Later more troops and police showed up.

They were followed by two people from Eli, including Dudu, the security officer from the settlement. "They demanded we leave," said Nir, "since they said the harvesting (by the Palestinians with Israeli civil rights activists) was not coordinated with them, and we were not allowed to cross the security road that surrounds Eli. But I was present when the harvest was coordinated with the District Liaison and Coordination Office. The Eli security officer was there as well. Last Monday, by the way, he told me he was once a Kach activist."

The police ordered the peace activists to move 100 meters away from the security road, just as the Eli security officer demanded. The Palestinians decided to give up and went home. That afternoon, a major from the civil administration showed up and after some conversation announced that only Jews - more precisely anyone except the Palestinians - would be allowed to pick olives in that area.

The prime minister did not need the media to learn that many of the youngsters he has sent to the hilltops over the years are hooligans and thugs for whom Palestinian lives and livelihood are worth less than a single olive. Security officials reported last year on the systematic harassment of olive harvesters throughout the territories. But the Israeli authorities are much more interested in enforcing the building laws - when it comes to Palestinians, not against the "illegal outposts."

Unless something comes up to change things, the day after tomorrow, the army will get permission from a military court to demolish half the small village of Aqaba in Samaria, including its kindergarten and mosque, which the authorities refused to grant permission to build.

Getting out of the mud
If there are no terror attacks in the coming days and Ben-Gurion airport workers don't go on strike, Jerusalem's empty hotels will get a moment of grace at the end of the week. Some 3,000 American Jews are due to arrive to take part in an unusual annual meeting of the General Assembly, better known as the GA.

If there are no terror attacks in the coming days and Ben-Gurion airport workers don't go on strike, Jerusalem's empty hotels will get a moment of grace at the end of the week. Some 3,000 American Jews are due to arrive to take part in an unusual annual meeting of the General Assembly, better known as the GA. Usually, the GA moves from one major American Jewish population center to another and its debates and discussions focus on the issues that trouble that Diaspora. This is only the second time in 70 years the GA has taken place in Jerusalem.

The invitation to the assembly says the decision to hold the session in Israel was a result of the desire "to enable the representatives of the Jewish community to demonstrate their support for Israel and its people at this difficult time." The slogan chosen for the event, "Shaping our Future," emphasizes the shared destiny of the two most important Jewish communities in the world.

To make that partnership tangible to the gentiles, especially those in the White House and on Capitol Hill, the Jews will also vote with their feet for Israel. The organizers invited all Israelis to join them on a march through terror-struck Jerusalem, and to spend time at its restaurants and shopping centers.

Without any cynicism, it must be said that it is a lovely gesture to the residents of the city, which has been hit so much by terrorism, and a worthy response to the enemies of peace. However, the thousands of good Jews making their way to Jerusalem are not merely emissaries of good will. Whether they want to or not, they will be turned into political emissaries of the Sharon government and its policies. TV viewers in Israel and the world will get the impression that thousands of Jews would not cross the oceans to identify with a government and its policies with which they disagree.

Those running for president and Congress will see the Jewish voters and donors cheering an Israeli prime minister who declares unceasing war on terror and swears Jerusalem will remain whole, never divided or shared. As far as the typical American politician is concerned, what's good for Israel in the eyes of Mr. Levy from New York and Mrs. Rabinowich from Florida, is good for him. In the coming U.S. election year, the Jewish lobby will become an important center of influence over decision makers in Washington. The candidates will be attentive to every sound and silence in the community regarding Israel. The Geneva Accords and Ami Ayalon's and Sari Nusseibeh's People's Voice, like Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon's criticism, brought the political option back to the public discourse in Israel. Statements by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz giving their blessings to the new peace initiatives have signaled the start of a similar discussion in the U.S.

As far as Powell is concerned, it can reasonably be said that American interests hide Israeli interests for him. But Wolfowitz, a right-wing conservative anxious for Israel's future, wouldn't have gone anywhere near Ayalon and Nusseibeh if he didn't believe their initiative was good for Israel. Presumably, the senior-most Jewish official in the Bush administration would not have praised an initiative based on the Clinton framework if he did not believe Israel has someone to talk to and something to talk about. Wolfowitz thus paved the way for all friends of Israel in the U.S. to reexamine their position regarding the Sharon government's policies.

American Jews, like other Americans, did not obediently cheer the senseless war in Vietnam. There is no reason they will behave differently when it comes to a senseless war in their historic homeland. Both as Jews and as Americans, their duty is to take a stand on the issues of peace and war in the Middle East, on the separation fence, and the land grabbing. They deserve to hear from the prime minister how to "shape the future" with a non-Jewish majority but without apartheid and transfer. They must demand that Yossi Beilin explain the way the Geneva Accords guarantee freedom of access to the Western Wall, Temple Mount and Mount of Olives. Marches and shopping in Jerusalem are moving gestures. But real identification isn't about stepping into the mud for an hour, but rather about participating in the long-term effort to get out of the mud.

Draconian rule

The news of the scrapping of the new forms [for press cards] from the Government Press Office was a welcome relief. I had received the new forms in the mail yesterday, and they can be described by one word only - draconian. Not only did they require your father's and grandfather's names in Hebrew and English, but an additional requirement was to have yourself "authenticated" by a notary and threatened punishment of the worst kind if any falsehood was discovered. Is this the sort of language one uses for journalists wishing to renew their press cards?

Even as a freelance journalist who does not dabble in politics, I found the whole matter distressing and reminiscent of the iron-fisted policies of the Apartheid government in South Africa when I lived there.

One hopes the next head of the GPO will be chosen with much more care, resulting in better relations with the foreign press, which appear to be at rock bottom right now.

Return overdue

Regarding "Teva Q3 results smash consensus," by Eli Daniel, Haaretz, November 4

It is very nice that Teva is such a success story. Teva is set to purchase a large company abroad, and the two leading banks in Israel agreed to extend a $ 1 billion credit line.

That credit is the money of all the small householders in Israel, many hundreds of thousands who keep their savings in these banks and earn a very low interest.

Teva owes a great deal to Israel, first the educated manpower who worked in R&D for the company. I remember when Teva was a small firm. I should like to know what the company does for Israel and it's citizens. Has Teva funded scholarships in the sciences for our young people?

Is Teva supporting the School of Pharmacy at the Hebrew University so that it can expand it research facilities?

Is Teva creating factories here for their products for the thousands of workers who are unemployed? I should like to know what the firm is doing for the economy and the citizens of Israel.

Waiting on the Arab world

"Regarding "U.S. can't walk away from its role" by Wesley Clark, Haaretz, November 10

There is much to recommend Gen. Wesley Clark's article but it is still unsatisfying. It's good that he acknowledges, for example, that the United States must never question Israel's right to defend itself.

The problem is his belief that American intervention will bring peace between Israel and its neighbors. If anything, the experience of General Clark's political patron, ex-president Bill Clinton, shows that American involvement may, in fact, be irrelevant.

There was no president more involved in Middle East peace-making than Clinton. Yet even his efforts could not bring peace and, in fact, arguably led to the current violence.

There is a riddle, "How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?" The answer is: "One, but the light bulb really has to want to change."

So it is with peace in the Middle East. American leverage will accomplish nothing until there is a fundamental shift in the Arab world generally and the Palestinian world in particular. The acceptance of Israel's legitimacy by the Arabs is the necessary ingredient for there to be peace in the Middle East. Without it, no amount of effort will ever be sufficient.

Storm warnings
As Israel's image reaches new lows worldwide, Jews from abroad - including many of those converging on Jerusalem this month - say their lives are being disrupted by growing anti-Semitism and fears for the future.
By Daniel Ben Simon	Nov. 14, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The seriousness of Israel's plight is attested to by the fact that the North American Federation of United Jewish Communities decided to move its General Assembly to Jerusalem, for the second time in GA history. This annual event, attended by thousands of Jewish leaders, convened in Israel only once before, when the country was celebrating its 50th anniversary. At that time, they came to take part in a gala celebration. Now they are coming to raise Israel's morale and say: Don't worry, American Jewry is behind you.

And not only American Jewry. In recent weeks, delegations of Jews from all over the world have been flocking to Israel. There is hardly a Jewish organization missing from the list. But this time, the purpose of the visit is different. Today, the Jews are not coming as tourists. They are not coming to travel around the country or snap pictures of the Israeli landscape. They are coming in droves to show their love for Israel in its time of need, and to share the fear and anxiety that has shaken up the lives of Jews everywhere.

Even Oro Serouya feels that her life as a Jew has changed unrecognizably. Serouya, an architect, who speaks a smattering of Hebrew, flew all the way from Brazil to attend the World Sephardi Federation conference held earlier this week in Jerusalem. She is staying on to participate in the GA, scheduled to open Sunday. "It gives me a chance to soak up a little Jewish experience and also feel that I'm helping Israel," says Serouya, choosing her words carefully.

Until recently, Serouya was president of the Brazilian Jewish community. Now she heads a tiny community of 1,200 Jews in Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon, where she lives. In places like these, people never heard of Israel until its soldiers took over the TV screen, says Serouya, who claims she was always a proud Jew with no qualms about flaunting her connection to Israel. Over the past three years, however, the atmosphere has changed, even in this out-of-the-way location.

"That's what brought me to Israel now," says Serouya this week, taking a break between a depressing discussion of Israel's problematic image in the world and a pessimistic report on the demographic threat facing world Jewry. "We don't have anti-Semitism like they do in Europe," she continues, "but today our lives depend on what is happening in Israel. Whatever a Brazilian knows about Israel, he gets from television. Brazilians used to love Israel, but now they say Israel is killing the Palestinians. Even when Israelis are hurt in terrorist attacks, they say on TV that it's because of the occupation. The intifada has changed the lives of Brazilian Jews because it comes into our living rooms. Hardly a day goes by that we don't see footage of dead Palestinians. And they always show Israeli tanks and soldiers shooting. It's very painful. Because what happens to you, affects us. It's true that in Brazil, they don't speak badly of Jews, but it's not pleasant to see how they portray Israel on television."

Sharp divisions

Those who worry about the low point Israel has reached in global public opinion are sharply divided over the reasons for it. Is opposition to Israel rooted in its military policy toward the Palestinians, or has anti-Semitism awoken after a long hibernation? As time passes and the negative attitude toward Israel intensifies, many Jews are beginning to feel that these sentiments are more anti-Semitic than anti-Israeli.

Prof. Shmuel Trigano of the University of Paris X, a prominent French Jewish intellectual, believes that the clash between the Jews and the non-Jewish world started out as anti-Israeli, in the wake of the intifada, but has spilled over into anti-Semitism. In France, he says, people are no longer embarrassed to express views about the Jews that were taboo until just a little while ago. "If they attacked Israeli politics, that would be understandable," Trigano said this week. "But today there is no shame. Intellectuals and journalists are explicitly challenging the State of Israel's right to exist."

Trigano remembers the days when Israel and Jewish identity were symbiotic in France. After the Holocaust, nothing seemed more natural. "But not anymore," he concludes. "The legitimacy of the State of Israel and the Jews' moral right to live there are no longer recognized by the French public. Something tragic has happened over the last few years, and we need to be on guard. Israel is being portrayed as a racist country, a country of apartheid founded on historic injustice to the Palestinians, a country that the world would be better off without. The myth that Jews came and conquered a settled land, driving out the poor, innocent Palestinian people, is becoming more and more engrained in French society. Your `new historians' have played a major role in this shift in attitude toward Israel, because their books have been translated. If these people appear all over the world and flagellate themselves over the sins of Zionism, why shouldn't others adopt this view?"

According to Trigano, the new discourse has sent shock waves through the Jewish community. "French Jews have begun to feel that their own legitimacy is being challenged. The Jews are deeply rooted in French civilization, but suddenly, with all our Frenchness, we have become refugees. In what other country is there active cooperation between leftist and Islamic students? An unprecedented and illogical alliance has been forged between the Muslim brothers and the ultra-leftists based on the shared idea that Israel is a country that practices apartheid."

`A frightening equation'

Yehoshua Amishav of Keren Hayesod discovered a similar trend in Belgium. A few days ago, he returned from a worrying visit to this country. While he was there, he discerned an odd political alliance between the far right and Trotskyite leftists. "The Palestinian issue is the connecting thread, and the same is true for the right wing and left wing all over Europe," he explains. "The far right and the Trotyskyites are bitter enemies in every possible sphere. They're capable of killing one another. But when it comes to Israel, they're comrades in arms."

During his visit to Belgium, Amishav found a Jewish community apprehensive about the change in attitude of their countrymen. To be desirable citizens, he learned in conversation with the locals, the Jews have to disassociate themselves from Israel. Those who support Israel will face the consequences. "That's a frightening equation," says Amishav. "In effect, the Jews are being held hostage by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

Minister of Diaspora Affairs Natan Sharansky encountered the same attitude when he met recently with the Belgian ambassador. When Sharansky asked him to take action against worrying manifestations of anti-Semitism in his country, the ambassador replied that the day Israel stops its operations against the Palestinians in the territories and the day pictures of murdered Palestinians stop flashing across the television screens, anti-Semitism will disappear.

Like Serouya, Trigano attributes the ill winds disrupting the lives of Jewish communities around the globe to the intifada. "The Palestinians used the intifada to destroy Israel's image as a moral, humane country," says Trigano. "They've done something unbelievable: They've turned the victims of the Holocaust into Nazis and child killers. And this conflict is not confined to the territories. Jews all over the world are in danger."

Brian Lurie, a prominent Jewish leader who came to Israel this week on a mission of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, has been having similar thoughts. A Reform rabbi by profession, Lurie's current vocation is "concerned Jew." Very concerned, says Lurie. He has always seen Israel as an inseparable part of his life and brought up his four children to love Israel.

The current pro-Israel mood in the United States is a far cry from the anti-Israel mood in Europe, but there is no guarantee that things will stay that way. "In the San Francisco area, actually, Israel's image is starting to change," Lurie says. "We've got all these local college students who are liberals and radicals, and they're very sensitive to injustice and discrimination. They head for the barricades whenever they hear a sad story. Today, the Palestinians are the story.

"If the intifada doesn't end soon, Israel is liable to lose its preferential standing in American public opinion. At this point, America is pro-Israel, and the TV networks are very nice and understanding toward Israel and the way it operates. But other currents, bubbling below the surface, are telling Americans that Israel is an occupier and an oppressor. This idea isn't fully rooted yet, but another five years of graphic images from the territories, and we'll start feeling it. As Americans and Jews."

Lurie has attended the GA in the past and has no illusions that this year's event will be any different from its predecessors. He does not believe that even one of the thousands of Jewish leaders thronging the conference halls will deviate from blind support of Israel and utter so much as a word of criticism. In massive assemblies of this kind, Jewish leaders keep their mouths shut, fearing that a note of dissent could touch off a landslide. "It's always been that way, and that's the way it's going to be," says Lurie in a tone of resignation.

If Lurie could address the prime minister directly, at some point during the GA, he would let him in on his secret thoughts, shared by many of his colleagues. "This is what I would say," says Lurie. "Mr. Prime Minister, for the sake of the future of the Jewish people and the State of Israel, please, evacuate the settlers from the Gaza Strip. And then insure that they leave the territories. That is the only way to save Israel - and world Jewry - from the terrible predicament in which it now finds itself. Please, I beseech you, do something to turn Israel back into the proud democracy it once was."

Analysis / Many Diaspora Jews fear for the future
The seriousness of Israel's plight is attested to by the fact that the North American Federation of United Jewish Communities decided to move its General Assembly to Jerusalem, something which it has only ever done once before in the history of the GA.

The seriousness of Israel's plight is attested to by the fact that the North American Federation of United Jewish Communities decided to move its General Assembly to Jerusalem, for the second time in GA history. This annual event, attended by thousands of Jewish leaders, convened in Israel only once before, when the country was celebrating its 50th anniversary. At that time, they came to take part in a gala celebration. Now they are coming to raise Israel's morale and say: Don't worry, American Jewry is behind you.

And not only American Jewry. In recent weeks, delegations of Jews from all over the world have been flocking to Israel. There is hardly a Jewish organization missing from the list. But this time, the purpose of the visit is different. Today, the Jews are not coming as tourists. They are not coming to travel around the country or snap pictures of the Israeli landscape. They are coming in droves to show their love for Israel in its time of need, and to share the fear and anxiety that has shaken up the lives of Jews everywhere.

Even Oro Serouya feels that her life as a Jew has changed unrecognizably. Serouya, an architect, who speaks a smattering of Hebrew, flew all the way from Brazil to attend the World Sephardi Federation conference held earlier this week in Jerusalem. She is staying on to participate in the GA, scheduled to open Sunday. "It gives me a chance to soak up a little Jewish experience and also feel that I'm helping Israel," says Serouya, choosing her words carefully.

Until recently, Serouya was president of the Brazilian Jewish community. Now she heads a tiny community of 1,200 Jews in Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon, where she lives. In places like these, people never heard of Israel until its soldiers took over the TV screen, says Serouya, who claims she was always a proud Jew with no qualms about flaunting her connection to Israel. Over the past three years, however, the atmosphere has changed, even in this out-of-the-way location.

"That's what brought me to Israel now," says Serouya this week, taking a break between a depressing discussion of Israel's problematic image in the world and a pessimistic report on the demographic threat facing world Jewry. "We don't have anti-Semitism like they do in Europe," she continues, "but today our lives depend on what is happening in Israel. Whatever a Brazilian knows about Israel, he gets from television. Brazilians used to love Israel, but now they say Israel is killing the Palestinians. Even when Israelis are hurt in terrorist attacks, they say on TV that it's because of the occupation. The intifada has changed the lives of Brazilian Jews because it comes into our living rooms. Hardly a day goes by that we don't see footage of dead Palestinians. And they always show Israeli tanks and soldiers shooting. It's very painful. Because what happens to you, affects us. It's true that in Brazil, they don't speak badly of Jews, but it's not pleasant to see how they portray Israel on television."

Sharp divisions

Those who worry about the low point Israel has reached in global public opinion are sharply divided over the reasons for it. Is opposition to Israel rooted in its military policy toward the Palestinians, or has anti-Semitism awoken after a long hibernation? As time passes and the negative attitude toward Israel intensifies, many Jews are beginning to feel that these sentiments are more anti-Semitic than anti-Israeli.

Prof. Shmuel Trigano of the University of Paris X, a prominent French Jewish intellectual, believes that the clash between the Jews and the non-Jewish world started out as anti-Israeli, in the wake of the intifada, but has spilled over into anti-Semitism. In France, he says, people are no longer embarrassed to express views about the Jews that were taboo until just a little while ago. "If they attacked Israeli politics, that would be understandable," Trigano said this week. "But today there is no shame. Intellectuals and journalists are explicitly challenging the State of Israel's right to exist."

Trigano remembers the days when Israel and Jewish identity were symbiotic in France. After the Holocaust, nothing seemed more natural. "But not anymore," he concludes. "The legitimacy of the State of Israel and the Jews' moral right to live there are no longer recognized by the French public. Something tragic has happened over the last few years, and we need to be on guard. Israel is being portrayed as a racist country, a country of apartheid founded on historic injustice to the Palestinians, a country that the world would be better off without. The myth that Jews came and conquered a settled land, driving out the poor, innocent Palestinian people, is becoming more and more engrained in French society. Your `new historians' have played a major role in this shift in attitude toward Israel, because their books have been translated. If these people appear all over the world and flagellate themselves over the sins of Zionism, why shouldn't others adopt this view?"

According to Trigano, the new discourse has sent shock waves through the Jewish community. "French Jews have begun to feel that their own legitimacy is being challenged. The Jews are deeply rooted in French civilization, but suddenly, with all our Frenchness, we have become refugees. In what other country is there active cooperation between leftist and Islamic students? An unprecedented and illogical alliance has been forged between the Muslim brothers and the ultra-leftists based on the shared idea that Israel is a country that practices apartheid."

`A frightening equation'

Yehoshua Amishav of Keren Hayesod discovered a similar trend in Belgium. A few days ago, he returned from a worrying visit to this country. While he was there, he discerned an odd political alliance between the far right and Trotskyite leftists. "The Palestinian issue is the connecting thread, and the same is true for the right wing and left wing all over Europe," he explains. "The far right and the Trotyskyites are bitter enemies in every possible sphere. They're capable of killing one another. But when it comes to Israel, they're comrades in arms."

During his visit to Belgium, Amishav found a Jewish community apprehensive about the change in attitude of their countrymen. To be desirable citizens, he learned in conversation with the locals, the Jews have to disassociate themselves from Israel. Those who support Israel will face the consequences. "That's a frightening equation," says Amishav. "In effect, the Jews are being held hostage by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

Minister of Diaspora Affairs Natan Sharansky encountered the same attitude when he met recently with the Belgian ambassador. When Sharansky asked him to take action against worrying manifestations of anti-Semitism in his country, the ambassador replied that the day Israel stops its operations against the Palestinians in the territories and the day pictures of murdered Palestinians stop flashing across the television screens, anti-Semitism will disappear.

Like Serouya, Trigano attributes the ill winds disrupting the lives of Jewish communities around the globe to the intifada. "The Palestinians used the intifada to destroy Israel's image as a moral, humane country," says Trigano. "They've done something unbelievable: They've turned the victims of the Holocaust into Nazis and child killers. And this conflict is not confined to the territories. Jews all over the world are in danger."

Brian Lurie, a prominent Jewish leader who came to Israel this week on a mission of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, has been having similar thoughts. A Reform rabbi by profession, Lurie's current vocation is "concerned Jew." Very concerned, says Lurie. He has always seen Israel as an inseparable part of his life and brought up his four children to love Israel.

The current pro-Israel mood in the United States is a far cry from the anti-Israel mood in Europe, but there is no guarantee that things will stay that way. "In the San Francisco area, actually, Israel's image is starting to change," Lurie says. "We've got all these local college students who are liberals and radicals, and they're very sensitive to injustice and discrimination. They head for the barricades whenever they hear a sad story. Today, the Palestinians are the story.

"If the intifada doesn't end soon, Israel is liable to lose its preferential standing in American public opinion. At this point, America is pro-Israel, and the TV networks are very nice and understanding toward Israel and the way it operates. But other currents, bubbling below the surface, are telling Americans that Israel is an occupier and an oppressor. This idea isn't fully rooted yet, but another five years of graphic images from the territories, and we'll start feeling it. As Americans and Jews."

Lurie has attended the GA in the past and has no illusions that this year's event will be any different from its predecessors. He does not believe that even one of the thousands of Jewish leaders thronging the conference halls will deviate from blind support of Israel and utter so much as a word of criticism. In massive assemblies of this kind, Jewish leaders keep their mouths shut, fearing that a note of dissent could touch off a landslide. "It's always been that way, and that's the way it's going to be," says Lurie in a tone of resignation.

If Lurie could address the prime minister directly, at some point during the GA, he would let him in on his secret thoughts, shared by many of his colleagues. "This is what I would say," says Lurie. "Mr. Prime Minister, for the sake of the future of the Jewish people and the State of Israel, please, evacuate the settlers from the Gaza Strip. And then insure that they leave the territories. That is the only way to save Israel - and world Jewry - from the terrible predicament in which it now finds itself. Please, I beseech you, do something to turn Israel back into the proud democracy it once was."

Which kind of binational state?
Israel and the Palestinians are sinking together into the mud of the "one state." The question is no longer whether it will be binational, but which model to choose.
By Meron Benvenisti	| Nov. 20, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
In the rush of refreshing statements heard lately, the warnings have come from the length of the political spectrum - from Ami Ayalon to Ehud Olmert and the Geneva accord initiators and Jewish intellectuals in America - Israel faces "a threat that could spell the end of the Jewish state," meaning the danger of the binational state. Within a few years, there will be a Palestinian majority between the Jordan and the Mediterranean and according to Olmert "more and more Palestinians are no longer interested in a solution of two states for two peoples." The result is "a disaster - one state for two people."

The vast majority of public opinion rejects that option and the academic sector is revolted by the binational concept, "which hasn't solved any conflict in the world and does not work anywhere except in Switzerland." The opposition is so strong and emotional that seemingly there's no need to even define what kind of regime it would be and what the term "one state for two peoples" might mean. Examining various regimes included in the binational model might show perhaps that one or more of the options could actually please some of those who meanwhile so vehemently denounce the binational approach as a disaster.

The connection between losing the Jewish demographic majority and the fear of the demand for equal voting rights for everyone - one man, one vote - that would bring an end to the Jewish state shows that the type of regime identified with binationalism is a classic liberal regime of individual rights in a unitary, centralized state, without any regard for ethnic-collective rights.

That's the kind of regime that replaced the apartheid government in South Africa and it works with relative success. If the Palestinians do indeed force the Israelis to impose such a model, as the blacks did in South Africa, it would indeed spell the end of the Jewish state in the sense of its ethnic dominance and other national privileges.

However, it is difficult to assume that such a situation would evolve in reality because the State of Israel today without the territories seemingly has a liberal democracy, but the Jewish community in it made sure to impose an "ethnic democracy" that gave the Arabs second class citizenship.

The fear of the loss of the majority has already yielded plans for campaigns against the danger, such as the projects for increasing the Jewish birth rate, granting voting rights to expatriates or even to Jews wherever they may be. The chance of fulfilling the unitary model is nil. But the effort to identify binationalism only with that model is deliberate, meant to prevent any debate about other, more attractive alternatives.

One such alternative is a system that recognizes collective ethnic-national rights and maintains power sharing on the national-central level, with defined political rights for the minority and sometimes territorial-cantonal divisions. That model, called "consociational democracy" has not succeeded in many places, but lately has been applied successfully to reach agreements in ancient ethnic-national conflicts such as Bosnia, through the Dayton agreement, and Northern Ireland, with the Good Friday agreement. That should be food for thought for the experts who contemptuously wave off the binational option.

Why did arrangements based on one state for two peoples work in various methods and places - South Africa, Bosnia, and Northern Ireland - while the Oslo accords, based on territorial division, achieved at the same time, collapsed?

The option of power sharing and division into federated cantons is closer to the model of the territorial division of two states but it avoids the surgery, so it allows the existence of soft borders, and creates a deliberate blurring that eases dealing with symbolic issues, the status of Jerusalem or the questions of refugees and the settlers. The mutual recognition allows preservation of the national-cultural character on the national level and preservation of the ethnically homogenous regions. Everything depends, of course, on recognition being mutual and symmetric.

Those who don't recognize and accept intercommunal equality propose a third model of binationalism - even though they rise up against the very idea. They suggest cultural and civic local autonomy, but without voting in the Knesset, or alternatively, voting in Jordan, the "real Palestinian state." That is Menachem Begin's original autonomy plan, or the "functional partition" proposed by Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres, a plan being implemented nowadays through the Palestinian Authority. That model has another version in the form of the "Palestinian state" defined by the separation fence: four cantons under Israel's indirect control. That's also a model for binationalism camouflaged by the division into "two states."

And there's a fourth model, which can be called "undeclared binationalism." It's a unitary state controlled by one dominant national group, which leaves the other national group disenfranchised and subject to laws "for natives only," which for the purposes of respectability and international law are known as laws of "belligerent occupation." The convenience of this model of binationalism is that it can be applied over a long period of time, meanwhile debating the threat of the "one state" and the advantages of the "two states," without doing a thing. That's the situation nowadays. But the process is apparently inevitable. Israel and the Palestinians are sinking together into the mud of the "one state." The question is no longer whether it will be binational, but which model to choose.

Reform leader: U.S. Jews must insist Israel halt settlements
By Nathan Guttman	and Haaretz Correspondent	| Nov. 24, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
NEW YORK - Rabbi Eric Yoffie, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, has issued a call to American Jews to exert their political influence in the U.S. in order to make the American administration prompt Israel to freeze all settlements immediately, regardless of what the Palestinians are doing.

"Continuing to build settlements is to threaten the Jewish character of the state and is to undermine the Zionist dream," Yoffie told Haaretz in an interview in his New York office.

Yoffie added that the goal of the settlement effort is to create a reality that is irreversible. "That's what scares me most of all," he says.

For Yoffie, the settlement issue is currently the most important issue on the agenda, because it is hastening the moment when the Jewish population across the Green Line will make the solution of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, no longer attainable.

"My fear is that very soon, it is going to be too late," he says adding, "Israel will need to choose between a democratic state with an Arab majority, or an apartheid state, and this is not what Zionism is about. We didn't dream of Zion for 2000 years in order to be a minority in somebody else's state," Yoffie said.

Yoffie also notes that the reawakening of the opposition in Israel, be it the Geneva Understanding, the Ayalon-Nusseiba document or the declaration of former Shin Bet security service heads, which he carefully reads in the Hebrew press, to a large degree gave American Jews the okay to again make their voices heard.

But more than anything else, he says, he feels that he can no longer stand by and remain silent when he believes that in another five years Israel will face a situation where a bi-national state will be the only possible solution. "The overwhelming importance of this issue dictates that we can no longer be silent," he says.

Sweating it out

1. Alibi

Last year, at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers, then-foreign minister Shimon Peres gave a fiery speech objecting to the EU's demand that Israel include some kind of geographic labeling on products that it exports to the continent. Among other things, Peres told his colleagues that this could rightly be brought up when negotiations were being conducted between Israel and the Palestinians over a final accord, but that there was no justification for it when the two parties were completely caught up in a violent conflict. The Europeans accepted his argument and backed down. In their time, Dalia Itzik of Labor, who preceded Ehud Olmert as Minister of Industry and Trade, and her predecessor, Ran Cohen of Meretz, also rebuffed pressure from the EU to specially label Israeli products that originated in the territories beyond the Green Line. This week, some senior figures in the Labor Party were amused to see Olmert making this concession to the EU. The blunter ones among them called him "a dishrag who can't take pressure."

Members of the current government's more rightist wing shared their view. Some said that Olmert had capitulated unnecessarily, and thus created a dangerous precedent that distinguishes between Israeli products from different sides of the Green Line. These ministers were also critical of how Sharon and his bureau handled the matter of last week's UN Security Council Resolution to adopt the road map. They wondered what UN Ambassador Danny Gillerman was doing during the decisive vote (he was on vacation in Paris), and what good were the optimistic assessments with which Sharon returned from Moscow regarding this matter (Sharon reported that President Putin had told him that Russia would not do anything to hurt either party to the conflict). The dominant theme of the right-wing ministers' complaints was that this was all just further proof of the poor functioning of Sharon's bureau and of Israel's UN delegation.

Belittling Olmert's resolve and finding fault with the skill of the UN delegation are both convenient ways of burying one's head in the sand; the Sharon government is starting to pay the price - in the international arena - for its policies toward the Palestinians. It is under siege without realizing it or being prepared to admit it.

Olmert was faced with a threat that could have cost the state an annual half billion dollar loss, and the UN delegation was helpless to do much in the face of an American-Russian alliance. And as if that were not enough, Sharon's bureau chief, Dov Weisglass, was made well aware of the limits of the U.S. administration's patience, and returned from Washington bearing word of a nearly $300 million reduction in American loan guarantees. It wasn't the skill of the Israeli emissaries that dictated these unhappy results, but the government's stance toward the Palestinians: The world has lost patience with the continuation of the occupation and with Israeli stratagems to perpetuate it, and is starting to inflict pain on Israel - by hitting it in the pocket, for one thing - in order to compel it to change its ways.

Sharon has his own perception, based on his military experience, of when a force is under siege and when it is doing the besieging (he sees this as something that is subjectively defined in accordance with the commander's degree of self-confidence). But if he just took a good look around, he would have to admit that the aggregate of recent developments in the international arena resemble a noose that is starting to tighten on Israel, reminiscent of the circumstances that led to the downfall of the apartheid regime in South Africa.

2. Precedent

Several weeks ago, Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations took note of Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov's desire to secure official UN Security Council acceptance of the road map. Hoenlein also pointed out the danger inherent in this: The road map would thus be transformed from an American document with the status of a proposed outline for an Israeli-Palestinian accord to a binding directive of the UN Security Council that countries like Syria and Algeria could interpret as they please and seek to implement accordingly. Hoenlein alerted the Israeli government and the Jewish lobby in the U.S., urging them to try to persuade the American administration to torpedo the UN Resolution. The effort seemed to be working: In Washington, they promised to get the idea frozen; in Moscow, Sharon got the impression from Vladimir Putin that Russia would withdraw its support for it, and in Israel they believed that the danger had passed.

Last week's development came as a surprise: Russia went ahead and presented its draft resolution and the United States did not object. Urgent entreaties from the Israeli Embassy in Washington, the Israeli UN delegation and the Conference of Presidents could not undo the Russian-American coalition. A talk that Ariel Sharon had with President Bush's Mideast adviser Elliot Abrams during his recent official visit to Rome was also of no avail. The Conference of Presidents recommended that a dramatic appeal be made to President Bush, but this suggestion was turned down. In retrospect, some in Jerusalem thought that this was the American administration's way of repaying Moscow for its support of the UN resolutions concerning U.S. involvement in Iraq.

Sharon's spokespeople were doing their best this week to give a reassuring characterization of the UN Resolution: The wording is very general; there's nothing threatening in it; Israel has already adopted the road map so there's nothing wrong with the UN extending its sponsorship to it as well. The Prime Minister's Bureau effectively likened the UN Security Council Resolution to the fish that were hastily removed from supermarket shelves this week and then hastily put back: One minute it's dangerous and the next it's worthy of being counted among the official international efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hoenlein is less sanguine: He says that the Security Council could now start to document whatever it defines as Israeli violations of the road map. The resolution explicitly says that the Council will monitor the road map's implementation. In the future, the Security Council could consequently decide to impose sanctions on Israel. Hoenlein also made an interesting observation: The Gulf War, which the United States declared on Iraq in 1991 with UN support, arose out of a similar process.

3. Threat

A similar thing happened with Israel's handling of the European demand for labels denoting a product's origins. Israel has been presented with this demand for over five years, and successive governments always resorted to stalling tactics: Under Ehud Barak, Minister of Industry and Trade Ran Cohen, Minister for Regional Development Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami explained to the EU that a peace accord based on an Israeli withdrawal from most of the territories - including from the industrial areas there - was just in the offing.

Subsequent governments argued that it was unacceptable for the EU to dictate Israel's permanent borders by defining its industries that are presently located in the territories as being outside the state's boundaries. In the current government, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has taken the same line, in an effort to buy time. This position, which was supported by the professionals at the Foreign Ministry, says that the dispute over tariff exemptions for products originating in the territories is a trivial economic issue and that the real motive behind the EU's pressing of this matter is political - the desire to pressure Israel to change its positions toward the Palestinians.

In meetings in Brussels two weeks ago, Silvan Shalom was able to obtain the EU's agreement to send a delegation to conduct negotiations with Israel; in other words, to stall for a few more months with the expectation that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians will resume by then. The Sharon government appeared to be sticking to the argument that Europe cannot determine the state's final borders and must leave this to the relevant parties.

Then Olmert went and overturned all that by agreeing to the special labeling for products manufactured in the territories. Shalom and his colleagues at the Foreign Ministry were livid: This is a grave precedent; the next thing you know, Israeli citizens will be given different classifications according to their place of residence when seeking visas for EU countries. From Olmert's perspective, there was no other choice. He informed Sharon and Shalom about which way he was leaning, and heard no reservations from them. He used his authority to make a decision on a matter that has been weighing on Israeli-European trade relations for over five years now.

Israeli exporters whose production plants are inside the Green Line lose hundreds of millions of shekels each year because of mistaken identifications by Europe, which bans products produced in the territories. Olmert was told that the entire tariff exemption (which amounts to about $500 million a year) could be suspended if a solution to the problem was not found quickly. Silvan Shalom was no stranger to this possibility; he was also informed of it during his talks in Brussels. Olmert's position is that all the fuss being made now is over nothing: The products' origins will be noted only on the accompanying export papers and not on the packaging itself. The tax break that exporters from the territories stand to lose will amount to no more than $12 million a year.

Olmert also believes that the state could compensate them for this, which is really the obligatory solution. Since the state is the one that made lands available to Israeli factory owners in the territories, funded the expansion of their infrastructure and built industrial areas for them, it should now be the one to subsidize the losses caused to them by the cancellation of the tax breaks from the EU.

4. Interpretation

Two days ago, in the Knesset cafeteria, Shimon Peres said that the real debate between Labor and Likud is over the significance of time. While the government lives from hand to mouth and is primarily interested in postponing the necessary decisions, the main opposition understands that within three years, the state will be in an incomparably worse situation, and in order to avert such a predicament, is advocating that decisions be made right now.

"What are we waiting for?" Peres asked angrily. "For the moment when Iran has nuclear weapons, when the Jewish demographic advantage is erased and when the economy hits absolute bottom?" Peres does not see the point of exerting himself in trying to decipher Sharon's intentions: Will he dismantle settlements, will he remove outposts, what exactly are the unilateral moves he is talking about? As he sees it, the key factor is the composition of the government, and judging by this yardstick, there is no chance that the prime minister will deviate substantially from his present policies. According to Peres, Sharon is a prisoner of the coalition that he put together: It will not allow him to reach a reasonable accord with the Palestinians, no matter what he says.

But the far-right ministers in Sharon's government take a different view of the prime minister's declarations: They believe him. They've noted the consistency with which he has expressed a readiness to come to far-reaching compromises with the Palestinians, including the uprooting of settlements and a withdrawal from a significant portion of the territories - from his declaration of willingness to recognize a Palestinian state, to his acceptance of the road map and of President Bush's vision of a future peace accord, his use of the term "occupation" and his recent allusions to a plan to take unilateral steps and to evacuate some settlements.

In their view, the only thing stopping Sharon from going ahead with this dastardly scheme is the behavior of the Palestinians: Even with all the slack that Sharon cut Abu Mazen, the latter still did not produce the goods. Sharon accepted the road map, but Yasser Arafat sabotaged its implementation. Sharon decided to hold the IDF's fire on several occasions, but Palestinian terror continued to strike at Israel and destroyed any chance of forging a more lasting cease-fire.

The ministers of the far right monitor Sharon's statements very carefully and remember them well, such as how he told Amram Mitzna, about six months ago, that evacuating Netzarim was out of the question, and how he is now signaling a readiness to do just that. How, a month ago, he announced that a unilateral solution would be a victory for terror and is now talking about just such a move. How throughout his entire political career, he adhered to the principle that the uprooting of settlements was unthinkable, and then a few months ago told Haaretz Magazine that leaving places like Beit El was a possibility.

Today, they wonder why Sharon sees any need to talk about dismantling outposts and making gestures to the Palestinians; in their view, as long as Abu Ala does not fulfill his part of the conditions stipulated in the road map (first and foremost, disarming the terrorist organizations), there is no justification for any Israeli concession whatsoever.

The Yesha Council shares this assessment. It now believes that Sharon is capable of anything, that he is not one of those people who are connected to the Land of Israel with every fiber of their being, that he is not a true-blue Likudnik. To their minds, he would be right at home ideologically in the Labor Party. They feel that his choice of the Likud as his political framework was thoroughly opportunistic. That's why the settler leaders take an utterly serious view of the scenario in which Sharon is behind the wheel of the bulldozer that comes to uproot settlements.

None of Sharon's actions have contradicted his declared positions. He hasn't taken a single real step that would constitute a concession of any kind to the Palestinians, and perhaps even the contrary. He has continued with the targeted assassinations policy and thus contributed to, if not caused, the undermining of the cease-fire. When confronted with those arguments, the settler leaders respond that just stating such ideas is extremely serious; it gives legitimacy to the demand that the State of Israel be returned to the borders of the Green Line.

And incidentally, the Yesha Council says it will not permit the removal of outposts at which families are residing - no matter how small their number.

Free, white and miserable
Three perspectives on the impossible situation of straight men today, from J.M. Coetzee, Israeli essayist Yitzhak Binyamini and the creators of 'Sex and the City.'
By Arik Glasner	Dec. 5, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
When the novel "Disgrace," by the recent winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, J.M. Coetzee, came out in Israel in 2000, some local reviewers and critics addressed the political context of this South African work. The novel was seen as portraying an apocalyptic reality that could also come to pass here in Israel (at the time, the second intifada had just broken out). Yet the core of the book is not South African politics; it is sexual politics, which is tied to South African politics only in order to underline the fact that in real African politics, it is easier to emphasize it. In other words, just as the new "liberal" order established in South Africa generates violence of a new type, so too have the changes in relations between the sexes in the West over the last few decades generated a new sort of "violence."

"Disgrace" is a brilliant composition, partly because of the presentation of the dichotomies of black-white, man-woman and strong-weak, both in contrast to each other and to the supreme dichotomy: good and evil. "Disgrace" is about a strong white man, Prof. David Lurie, who is forced to leave his university because of "sexual harassment" of a student. Through the description of his trial and his dismissal, the book undermines our "liberal" and "progressive" conventions - and the rest is taken care of by his daughter's rape by blacks. Because the black rapists are good, or bad? The macho man is condemned, is abnormal, peculiar and therefore: weak. Is he now good, or bad? And so, the rape of Lurie's daughter - who is a farmer seeking to lead a "simple" existence - by three "freed" blacks does not come, as the cliche goes, to demonstrate the ease with which "the oppressed become the oppressors." No. The rape is an illustration of the novel's central theme: relations between men and women. There, too, according to the novel, things are more complex and are not part of a "war of freedom" devoid of biases and interests, devoid of oppression of a new sort.

The great liberal and socialist traditions that sustain us in the West are traditions of suspicion with respect to religion, morality and everything else. Therefore, without for a moment doubting the importance of the feminist revolution and the liberation of the blacks from the apartheid regime, their presentation as an idyll and an ideal should cause us skeptics discomfort. And that is what Coetzee does: He presents this discomfort bluntly, with a clear and laconic poeticism, in the Hemingway mold.

David Lurie, the professor of modern languages who becomes an adjunct professor of communications at the "Technical University," knows he is living in a "liberal" era, and his students are "post-Christian, post-history, post-educated." No one is interested in his cultural knowledge; the departments of classic studies and modern languages have closed long ago, and the professor also knows that the book that he will soon be writing about Byron (a symbol of Don Juan machismo) will lie there like a stone, never to be upturned. Totally lacking any orientation to the new religion called "sexual harassment," the professor starts an affair with one of his students. This is where the story begins. As his daughter says, without judging him, Lurie is a "moral dinosaur."

But Coetzee is wise enough to portray his protagonist - who is pathetic and tends toward melodramatics - in a sympathetic manner. Lurie spots hints of Stalinesque moralizing in the vicious self-righteousness directed at him: He is not only required to confess, but also to express remorse publicly and to "go for counseling" for having desired his pupil. "It is a puritanical age, charges Lurie; one's private life is a public matter."

He refuses to publicly admit guilt or express remorse, albeit somewhat quixotically and ridiculously: His legal "argument," he tells his daughter, is based on the importance of Eros - "that god that stirs up a trembling even in the littlest birds." Lurie's friend, a lawyer who keenly understands the spirit of the times, advises the professor to ask for a woman to represent him in the sexual harassment case, but Lurie refuses. His ex-wife, sarcastic but empathetic, sums up his situation: "No sympathy, no compassion - not in this era."

Mountains of terminology

The poetry of the novel is patent. It is obvious to us what the man wants and what difficulties and conflicts (including, it should be noted, internal conflicts) he faces. This is not so with respect to the poeticism of a philosophical work recently published in Israel on the same subject, written by Yitzhak Binyamini, entitled, "What Does a Man Want?" This book resembles Coetzee in several respects.

Why is theoretical writing or the writing of essays considered a "difficult" experience? The first explanation that comes to mind: The subject being explained or described is complicated and delicate, and therefore its description or elucidation is complicated and difficult. However - as the cliche goes, a story about boredom cannot be boring - is it not right to demand that the description of a bleak reality not be more convoluted or bleak than the reality itself? Another hypothetical explanation for the "difficulty" of theoretical writing has to do with the possibility that it conceals the paucity of its findings in mountains of grandiloquent terminology. A third explanation concerns the "short-mindedness" of the reader of the essay or theory.

I don't suspect that Binyamini's employment of "theory" stems from a need to conceal the paucity of his insights. Although some of his major "food groups" (Lacan, Irigary and others) do not generate the same wonderful feelings in everyone, this is invariably going to be the case when theory-essay-insight is laid like a snug blanket over the clefts and hollows of any given reality. The significance of Binyamini's book lies in its deviation from its very own intellectual food groups.

Just as the modern secular person reading kabbalistic works has to sift through the dense terminology that is no doubt part of the trash can of intellectual history, to find the living, vibrating emotions that break through the hundreds of years, so too does the reader of Binyamini's book suddenly come up against - through a screen of dense terminology - an extraordinary clarity that sends a real signal of cultural distress.

Binyamini's prose turns lucid only when he addresses the backbone of the book: the problems of modern man, the distress that no theoretical body has taken on itself to plumb, the sense of fresh directness that suddenly breaks through, like isolated islands in a dark and stormy theoretical sea. "The woman-world demands: `You should be ashamed of yourself, all of a sudden you can't get it up? Worthless scum! So what if you're tired - earn the living, and screw!" This is Binyamini's important, and ever so simple, line of argument.

Binyamini and Coetzee (one with stark clarity, the other with partly cloudy, intermittent clarity) chart an impossible reality of postmodern, straight masculinity. Anyone keeping tabs on popular culture is well aware that this man, "the new man," is on the one hand told to be un-macho, but on the other hand, manly and exciting with his "partner" in bed (and expressions of feminine discomfort from the wishy-washiness of the "the new man" can also be found in popular culture). The reader also knows that "the new man" is told, and justly so, to relate with equality to feminine sexuality and to women's professional aspirations, but is also still considered the one who has to "earn the living." This is not the old-fashioned, reactionary reliance on the man as breadwinner; rather, his ability to "earn a living" is seen as part of the package of sexual attractiveness.

A troubled place

Thus it is that in a progressive television series like "Sex and the City," the women, who carry on free and liberated sex lives, relate with an exaggerated lack of indifference to the financial standing of the men they go out with. In short, the new man is allowed to cry, but in bed - and only with his partner! - he should be tough. He has to respect the woman's equality, but not take it too seriously, and he has to make a lot of money. As Binyamini puts it: "Earn the living - and screw!"

Binyamini's book, then, comes from a troubled place. The "other" - the woman - receives the full attention: "It now seems that the little that remains is to make do with a one-way contemplation of the `other' - the woman."

Binyamini identifies the man's anachronistic standing as a temporarily acceptable "museum" status: "A non- museum Phallus Museum that has not yet been banned." The man, he says, is proletarian in that the culture assigned him the task of "doer," as opposed to the woman, who does not "act." However, this is most certainly a ploy, argues Binyamini, a ploy that presents "doing" as noble, as a "prize" for the man, as opposed to womanly passivity, which is construed as inferior. Binyamini can argue, as does Coetzee, in a paraphrase of Lennon (and Ono): Man is the nigger of the world.

There are differences of nuance between Coetzee and Binyamini. Binyamini is not as engaged in the erotic restrictions imposed on the man, but in the reverse - in the command that culture burdens him with: "Screw well" (In "Bereavement and Failure," Joseph Haim Brenner already pinpointed this phenomenon, of turning sexual desire into a Nietzschean cultural decree, into a bizarre type of superego). Coetzee's protagonist, on the other hand, likens his situation to that of a dog whose owner used to beat it whenever a female came close, a sort of Pavlovian attempt to negate its sexual desire. The dog "began to despise its own nature ... It was ready to punish itself. At this stage, it would have been better to shoot it," notes Lurie. Coetzee's hero also considers self-castration - in an entirely practical, comical way.

There are no psychoanalytical abysses or pseudo-psychoanalytical abysses, as one encounters in the works of Levin, for example. No. The man's fate, in Coetzee's realistic novel, derives from a concrete cultural situation that sends the man, at best, contradictory messages, and at worst, depressing messages. In Binyamini, the heavy terminology conceals his authentic and decidedly unfashionable shouted-out protest. Conversely, many insights await those readers able to surmount the terminology.

Look, despite my ostensibly "reactionary" message, I am one of the good guys. I read Lacan with you, I was moved by the poeticism of Irigary, I founded a subversive publishing house, but ... In this sense, since the situation of the straight male is mute, it can easily give rise to frustration and even violence. But there is also a modest blessing in it all: It enables the presentation of a simple, clear argument instead of an unexplainable "theory." Binyamini gives this to us intermittently, as simply a "description" of the situation.

Hamas chief Yassin rejects coexistence with Israel
By DPA	| Dec. 6, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Hamburg - Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has again rejected the continued existence of Israel next to an independent Palestinian state, telling a German news magazine a Jewish state could be established in Europe.

In interview excerpts slated for general distribution Monday in Der Spiegel, the elderly cleric opposed a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state would side by side with Israel, which would withdraw to its 1967 borders.

"That would not work," he said. "The Israelis claim 80 per cent of the territory and will only let us have 20 per cent. It would only be an interim solution."

The bearded paraplegic, who is the founder and spiritual leader of the largest and most militant of all the Palestinian groups fighting the Israeli occupation, also rejected the symbolic Geneva Accord. The peace plan was recently hammered out by opposition Israeli politicians and Palestinian representatives.

"That plan is worse than the Oslo one, because it abandons the right of return for the refugees," he said.

The objective of Hamas was to ensure "all Palestinians can live in their homeland, with all religions together: Moslems, Christians and Jews. We are against a Jewish apartheid state on Palestinian soil."

Asked if there was no place at all for a Jewish state, he said, "They could set up a state in Europe."

He said Hamas resistance would continue till the Israeli occupation was ended.

Trying to hide the dark backyard
As sophisticated as the fence might be and as high as it might go, it will not manage to hide anything. Beyond it, the occupation will continue in all its fury, and Israel's chance of becoming a just society will recede ever further and further away.
By Gideon Levy	| Dec. 7, 2003 | 12:00 AM

How many Israelis have actually seen the separation fence? How many have given any thought to its significance? Every foreign visitor interested in what is happening in the region makes visiting the fence a priority and world media constantly point their cameras at it - half a dozen foreign documentaries have already been shot along it. But most Israelis have never seen it.

This ambitious strategic project that is going to make fundamental changes to the land, the landscape and relations between the peoples, is passing through us with an amazing combination of utter indifference and astonishing ignorance. Since the start of the settlement enterprise, which also took place with eyes deliberately closed in national blindness, there has not been a venture that with such speed created a new reality without any real discussion of its significance. Even environmental activists haven't piped up about how it is ripping up the landscape.

Just like the settlements, the project was started by the Labor Party while the Likud gave it the proper momentum, and just like the settlements, it will be a tragedy to be suffered for generations to come. Another year or in five, and the truth about the damage it caused will become evident, and then, just as with the settlements, it will be too late. After the settlements fulfilled their destructive purposes and capabilities, the separation fence is the next fateful obstacle Israel is putting up on the path to reconciliation with the Palestinians.

When its construction is completed, the two-state solution will be even further removed and practically impossible. The settlements and the fence are complementary and supplementary, together they form a victorious proposition - that with them in place it will never be possible to reach an equitable peace.

There's no doubt the people want a fence. The polls show that most Israelis are convinced that separation from the Palestinian people is a magic formula for eliminating terror and that the fence is the guarantee of it. Together with other mendacious myths, Ehud Barak is also largely responsible for that, by turning the separation concept into a vision. But Barak's mantra of "us here and them there" quickly turned into "them there and us here and also over there."

Palestinians are corralled into ghettos beyond the fence and Israelis remain on both sides. The result being carved into the hills and dales of the land separate not only Israelis and Palestinians, but also Palestinians from Palestinians. The vision of separation espoused by Barak, Haim Ramon and Benjamin Ben-Eliezer has turned into a vision of apartheid.

The first outrageous aspect of this is the harm down to the tens of thousands of Palestinian families after they went through all the tribulations of the occupation - closures, land grabs, house demolitions, humiliations, checkpoints and the settlers in their midst. Now they are being torn form their fields, work places and schools, from their families and the centers of their life, living behind a fence.

"Good fences make good neighbors?" No they don't, not when the fence goes through the neighbor's backyard, over his land, and displaces the neighbors from their own land. That makes for bad neighbors. Some 75,000 Palestinians who find themselves in fenced-in enclaves, some 100,000 residents of the northern Jerusalem neighborhoods cut off from the city and the thousands of farmers already displaced from their land, are the next reservoir of hatred and despair and the new infrastructure of terror.

Israel wanted a security fence as a response to terror? It could have been so simple. It should have put it up on the Green Line, without any deviations. Israel wants separation from the Palestinians? It's so simple - it should evacuate the settlements.

Indeed, the fence does not signal good tidings for the future of relations between the nations. Instead of seeking to establish two open civil societies, living side by side in cooperation, as is desirable and possible, a wall is going up. However, even if it is sad to think that Israel converted its expressed desire for peace and conciliation into separation, if the fence had gone up on the Green Line it would have been impossible to complain about a nation trying to defend itself, and despite the serious problems that fence would have created, it would have been possible to live with it. But the fence is being built in a large part of Palestinian territory. On that route, nobody can accept the argument that the fence is apolitical. Like other occupation measures - especially the settlements and checkpoints - the fence is being justified by security rationales that only provide cover for their real purpose. That is, smashing the last chance for an agreed upon arrangement between the sides.

The fence therefore means the precise opposite of its declared purpose. It is a fence for the perpetuation of conflict. It won't separate the peoples, but perpetuate the pathological connection between the two peoples, the connection between the occupier and the occupied, blocking any chance for the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.

The fence's construction is heading into its last stretch, from the "Jerusalem envelope" to the "Hebron envelope" and the route in the north, and horrifyingly, "the eastern fence." Soon Israel will find itself behind walls, trying to hide from the horrific reality of its own dark backyard, where it conducts a brutal, ruthless regime of occupation.

As sophisticated as the fence might be and as high as it might go, it will not manage to hide anything. Beyond it, the occupation will continue in all its fury, and Israel's chance of becoming a just society will recede ever further and further away - until it disappears.

UN vote sends fence discussion to int'l court
The UN General Assembly voted yesterday in favor of a resolution asking the International Court of Justice in The Hague for an advisory opinion on the legal implications of Israel's building a separation fence in the West Bank and Jerusalem.
By Aluf Benn	| Dec. 9, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The UN General Assembly voted yesterday in favor of a resolution asking the International Court of Justice in The Hague for an advisory opinion on the legal implications of Israel's building a separation fence in the West Bank and Jerusalem.

The vote in favor of the resolution - 90 for, 8 against and 74 abstentions - was expected after the European Union failed to persuade the PLO to withdraw the request. Observers said the fact that the resolution was not supported by so many countries, most of them democratic nations, could have an effect on the ICJ's opinion.

Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Gillerman, described the fence as "Arafat's fence," saying it had been built because of the terror initiated by the Palestinian Authority's chairman.

Senior Jerusalem officials said the advisory opinion is expected to be given in about six months, and likely will entail an anti-Israel decision criticizing human rights violations against the Palestinians. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom have decided to cooperate with the ICJ and to present Israel's position that the fence's construction is a legal self-defense act in the face of Palestinian terror.

The Foreign Ministry last night denounced the "cynical use" of the general assembly for "furthering the interests of the supporters of terror... If the Palestinians would instead devote their energies to holding direct and serious negotiations with Israel... it would be possible to resolve the dispute," the ministry said in a statement.

It stressed the point Israel plans to raise at the ICJ - that the fence is a non-violent, temporary measure designed to protect human lives, and which has already proven itself by preventing terrorists from carrying out their intentions to bomb Israeli targets. Sharon yesterday reiterated that the fence did not mark either a political or security border. The ICJ debate is expected to raise questions of principle relating to the legality of Israeli settlements and occupation in the territories and East Jerusalem, and the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the transfer of populations to occupied territories.

Court's two Arab judges Jerusalem officials are particularly concerned about partiality in the ICJ ruling given the composition of the court's bench - two of whose 15 judges are Arabs. Before assuming their current ICJ posts, both the Egyptian and Jordanian judges expressed opinions against the occupation and called the settlements illegal. The Egytpain judge is Nabil Elaraby, a former UN ambassador and legal adviser to the Egyptian foreign ministry who has extensive experience in dealing with Israel. Elaraby represented Cairo at the international arbitration tribunal over the Red Sea resort of Taba, a case which Israel lost.

On the eve of his appointment to the ICJ in August 2001, Elaraby gave an interview to the Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram in which he advised the Arabs to take their conflict against Israel to international legal forums. "We did not get all we wanted, but it was still easy, because, history, law and geography were on our side," he said at the time. "UN jurisprudence, in fact, has always been on the Arab side. Israel avoids the UN because it means that a third party will always be looking at the facts." Elaraby continued in the same interview: "Israel is occupying Palestinian territory, and the occupation itself is against international law.

Israel has twice, in writing, with the whole world as witness, committed itself to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 on the occupied territories: once at Camp David with Egypt [in 1978], and once in Oslo with the Palestinians [in 1993]." Turning to the Sharon government, Elaraby added: "[It] has launched a new strategy, wreaking confusion and gaining time by describing territories Israel has already recognized as occupied as `disputed.'

All these are attempts to confuse the issues and complicate any serious attempt to get Israel out of the occupied territories. You can negotiate security, which will be mutual for both parties, but you cannot negotiate whether to leave or not." The Jordanian judge who sits on the ICJ bench is Awn Khasawneh, the former legal adviser to the foreign ministry in Amman. He was part of the Jordanian team that negotiated the peace treaty with Israel (he worked opposite Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein and Foreign Ministry legal adviser Alan Baker.) When his candidacy for the ICJ came up four years ago, Israel voted in favor of his appointment in the UN General Assembly. Before the appointment, Khasawneh expressed strong sentiments against Israel.

In a special report to the UN in 1997 on human rights and population transfer, Khasawneh pointed to a legal lacuna that made it possible for Israel to continue building settlements in the territories even after the military administration was dismantled following the Olso Accords.

Earlier, Khasawneh had coordinated the UN sub-committee on the prevention of discrimination and the protection of minorities, which in 1993 condemned Israel for "flagrant violations of international law and the Geneva Convention," the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes and homeland, the establishment of settlements in the territories, and the "terrorist systems" employed against "Syrian citizens on the occupied Golan." There are also two Jews on the 15-man bench - Rosalyn Higgins of the United Kingdom and Thomas Buergenthal of the United States, the son of Holocaust survivors. The Brazilian judge, Francisco Rezek, was a former foreign minister and in that capacity served to strengthen ties with Israel. All 15 judges will participate in discussions on the separation fence. Only an advisory opinion The ICJ opinions are advisory and not binding on the UN.

Jerusalem sources said that the United States probably would prevent imposition of sanctions against Israel when the issue comes up in the Security Council, and that it would go to the General Assembly where "another cycle of attacks against Israel and proposed anti-Israel resolutions" could be expected. Baker yesterday recalled a 1971 ICJ opinion which stated that South Africa's rule over Namibia was illegal.

This was merely an advisory opinion, he said, but served as the basis for imposing international sanctions against the apartheid regime and led to Namibia's independence in 1990. In 1986, the Arab countries attempted to get a similar advisory opinion from the ICJ on the legality of Israeli settlements in the territories. The move then was foiled by western countries. At the time, Israel decided to renege on its previous commitment to accept the ICJ's opinions on international conflicts. This was prompted by the UN's refusal to elect Shabtai Rosenne, the first legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry and a renowned expert on the ICJ, to the international court.

People and Politics / Arafat recognizes Jewish tie to Zion
Years of international peace activity, 'leftist' positions and long-standing relationships with the Palestinian leadership turned Henry Siegman into a welcome visitor in Ramallah, Riyadh and Cairo.
By Akiva Eldar	| Dec. 11, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Years of international peace activity, "leftist" positions and long-standing relationships with the Palestinian leadership turned Henry Siegman into a welcome visitor in Ramallah, Riyadh and Cairo. Siegman, a Hebrew-speaking New York Jew, and a past executive director of the American Jewish Congress, has spent the last few years as head of a Middle East "task force" for the American Council on Foreign Relations. On Wednesday, he spent a long hour with Yasser Arafat in the Muqata, with Dr. Saeb Erekat, who headed the Palestinian negotiating team with Israel, and Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh.

"There's a stormy argument underway in Israel if there is a Palestinian partner for peace," Siegman began, mentioning the Geneva Accord as a model for a permanent agreement, the growing calls for unilateral withdrawal, and the claim that there is no Palestinian partner for a reasonable agreement. Siegman mentioned Ehud Barak, who insisted on saying the PA Chairman rejects any connection between the Jewish people and their country and Jerusalem, its capital. He said that in Israel and around the world, people say that Arafat has not given up on the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to Israel as a way to eliminate the Jewish state.

Maybe the time has come for you to express your explicit views on these issues," Siegman suggested to Arafat. After a brief hesitation, Arafat agreed to allow the American visitor to ask all the questions that are bothering him, and promised to answer each one. The conversation was in English, translated into Arabic, and the answers were given to Arafat before he approved their publication. Arafat's office yesterday affirmed the veracity of the quotes.

Arafat, the man Israel declared to be "irrelevant" - while only yesterday it was published that the strategic team preparing the annual report to the Herzliya Conference on National Security is recommending that Israel undertake dialogue with him because the alternative is Hamas, with which it is impossible to reach an agreement - crosses three important lines in the conversation with Siegman. The first is a declaration about recognition of the historic link between the Jewish people and the land of Palestine - and its political ramifications. Arafat said it after Siegman pointed out that many people point to Arafat's insistence on Jerusalem being the capital of Palestine, and that the Haram a Sharif, which the Jews refer to as the Temple Mount, must be under Palestinian sovereignty, as proof that the Palestinians do not recognize or respect the historic Jewish connection to the country.

There will obviously be those who claim Arafat has more than one reason to sing lullabies in Israeli and American ears - the Siegman interview is appearing today in the New York Times, as well. On the other hand, presumably he knows his words will also appear in Arabic and be studied in the mosques of Nablus, Gaza, Cairo and Beirut.

Jewish sovereignty at the Western Wall

Asked what he has to say in response to the accusations he does not recognize the Jewish people's link to the land, Arafat said, "They are entirely untrue. My religion, Islam, obliges me to respect Judaism and Jewish history, whose prophets are revered in the holy Koran as God's messengers. While we insist that East Jerusalem be the capital of a Palestinian state, and that the Haram al-Sharif, on which are situated the two mosques, Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock, come under Palestinian sovereignty, we accept Jewish sovereignty over the Wailing Wall and over the Jewish quarter of the Old City. We accept this only because we recognize and respect the Jewish religion and the Jewish historical attachment to Palestine."

The second line Arafat crosses deals with the issue that broke out in the wake of the Geneva Accord, about whether the Palestinians recognize Israel as the Jewish state or the state of the Jewish people. Siegman asked, "We want to encourage coexistence between our two peoples and the three religions for the future of our children and their children. Do you object to the Jewish character of the State of Israel?"

Arafat: "I have officially recognized the State of Israel, as have the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority, on numerous occasions. It follows from that recognition that the government and the citizens of Israel have the right to determine the identity and character of the State of Israel, as long as it remains a democratic state that grants equal rights to others, including its large Arab population. I would claim the same rights and accept the same obligations for the State of Palestine."

Those who want to find the half-empty glass will say Arafat evaded saying explicitly "I recognize the Jewish character of the State of Israel." It's not difficult to guess what the reactions of Israeli Arabs like Azmi Bishara would be to such such a response. But those who prefer the half-full glass can say that it's not up to a foreign leader to define the character of a neighboring sovereign state. Arafat in effect is saying that if Israel's citizens and government decide that the state has a Jewish character, they're welcome to do so. If they want it to be Haredi, that's also okay. But the state must protect the rights of the Arab minority.

The third line deals with the right of return. Siegman told Arafat that his concern for the Palestinian refugees "has its parallel in the concern of Israel's government for its Jewish population in the context of the Palestinian demand for the return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. Are you prepared to agree to a formula that would place mutually agreed limitations on the return of Palestinian refuges to Israel?"

Anyone expecting Arafat to speak the words, "I hereby announce the refugees of Haifa and Jaffa have no right to return to their homes," is allowed to be disappointed. Those who want can be encouraged that his answer does not include the term "right of return." He says "this is an issue that was dealt with in the resolution adopted by the Arab League in its summit meeting in Beirut in March 2002. That resolution, approved by all Arab countries and by the PLO, specifies that the Palestinian refugee problem must be resolved in a manner that is just and acceptable to both parties, Israel and the Palestinian leadership. As I said, the PLO endorsed this resolution."

And that resolution, in effect, gives Israel the right to veto the number of refugees to be allowed into its territory, if any at all.

The conversation also covered Arafat's views on territorial exchanges, as proposed by both the Clinton framework and the Geneva Accord. "We are willing to accept limited territorial exchanges, equal in size and value, as long as these exchanges are the result of negotiations and mutual agreement, not an Israeli unilateral decision," he told the American Jewish interviewer. "The only condition is that such exchanges not compromise Palestinian territorial contiguity, access to our water aquifers and the integrity of our Palestinian population. What I mean by this last point is that we would not want large numbers of Palestinians to find themselves in areas annexed by Israel as the result of such exchanges."

Siegman asked, "What are your objections to Israel's erection of a security fence?" and Arafat answered along the same lines as his prime minister, Ahmed Qureia. "If Israel were building such a security fence on its own territory, we would not object to it. Even though we believe such a fence stands for the very opposite of the open and neighborly relations we would like to forge with Israel and the just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the region. As long as the fence is on Israel's own land, Israel can do what it wants. But the fence is being built on Palestinian land and its purpose is to preempt permanent status negotiations required by the road map by unilaterally creating facts on the ground. It represents a theft of Palestinian land and has nothing to do with Israel's security, as four previous heads of Israel's Shin Bet have recently said. If continued, this fence will be an apartheid fence confiscating 58 percent of West Bank territory and create a Berlin wall around Jerusalem."

Finally, Siegman asked about how the putative Palestinian state would deal with security issues, and Arafat offered a response that wraps concern for Palestinian security with concern for Israeli security. "The new State of Palestine will have its own security concerns. We will welcome American, European and other international forces on our borders with Israel and within the territory of the Palestinian State, as currently practiced in Sinai, South Lebanon and Golan Heights, to assure our security vis-a-vis Israel, by far a more militarily powerful nation than we are, and to monitor and to assist in the implementation of Palestinian compliance with the terms of our agreement with Israel. We are prepared to accept limitations on the Palestinian state's military capacities, and our compliance with these limitations will also be monitored by these international forces. It is our intention and determination to establish the closest security cooperation with Egypt, Jordan and Israel, our immediate neighbors. We also intend to establish economic cooperation with our neighbors, following the Benelux or NAFTA models."

Sharon's perception of time
Disturbingly, there's at least one indication that Ariel Sharon really thinks time is on his side: The prime minister clings to his belief that "a million Jews" will immigrate to Israel, and defuse the demographic threat to the Jewish state.
By Akiva Eldar	| Dec. 15, 2003 | 12:00 AM

Disturbingly, there's at least one indication that Ariel Sharon really thinks time is on his side: The prime minister clings to his belief that "a million Jews" will immigrate to Israel, and defuse the demographic threat to the Jewish state. Nary a meeting with wealthy, visiting Jews goes by without Sharon preaching to his guests about immigrating to Israel.

The troubling thing is that when a leader believes time is on his side, he has no reason to try to change reality. Yitzhak Shamir, who was sure the passage of time would strengthen the vision of Greater Israel, formulated the doctrine this way: "In the end, the Arabs will get used to the situation."

That doctrine brought about the first intifada, the struggle against the Oslo process (before the first terror attack), and various ploys to evade negotiations for a final status agreement. The camp that believes "time is on our side" accuses the left of succumbing to a "now-ism" that erodes Israel's bargaining ability. Let's give them another year or two (say those who believe that time is on our side), and ignore doomsayers, such as the former head of the Shin Bet security service, and the Israel Defense Forces will win the contest. Let's get rid of a heretic like Yossi Beilin, and the Palestinians will rid themselves of Yasser Arafat. Remove a defeatist like former IDF chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, and Arafat will be replaced by a leadership that will happily lap up the fenced-off Bantustan that Sharon will so generously offer.

In his Herzliya speech last year, Sharon criticized Israelis who hope the dispute with the Palestinians can be solved with a "wave of the sword." Sharon said a solution can only be found in a "piecemeal, careful" fashion. At the behest of Sharon's careful, incremental method, thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed or injured over the past year; masses have fallen below the poverty line; billions of dollars have been squandered; hatred has mounted; and the demographic threat has increased. The first stage in Sharon's Herzliya 2002 plan was the "replacement of the Palestinian leadership" (after which there was to be a Palestinian state in "A" and "B" lands, and final status talks).

Before he delivers his Herzliya 2003 speech, Sharon would be wise to review a report formulated by former Shin Bet officials and IDF intelligence officers, along with a group of Middle East experts, and submitted to the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. Sharon will find that time is working against him, even with respect to the first stage of his plan: The truth is, if we don't act quickly and make a deal with Arafat, the day will come when we miss him. "Arafat's removal would in all likelihood aggravate processes of dissolution in Palestinian society," the report concludes. After Arafat is gone, it adds, "the advent of warlords is to be expected."

The report's authors claim the struggle against Israel will serve as a calling card, and as a demonstration of national commitment, among various Palestinian groups that will vie for a premier role; and so this internal struggle will not curb the motivation to carry out terror strikes against Israel. The Islamic groups will be the main beneficiaries of the demise of a cohesive Palestinian civil society that might have directed social ferment toward democratic channels. Hamas is likely to emerge as the only political force that has enough clout, status and strength to mobilize the Palestinian public. The absence of an effective Palestinian leadership could confer a death sentence to hopes for serious negotiations, and for the restoration of peace and quiet on the ground, the report concludes.

The people who authored this report, figures such as Major General (res.) Yaakov Amidror, former head of IDF intelligence research, are hardly Peace Now activists. These are sober people who are ringing the alarm bells. Time is playing into the hands of fanatics and criminals on both sides, and against those who believe in compromise and the rule of law. Time is on the side of the nightmare of apartheid, or the end of Zionism; the passage of time is against our parents, who sought the establishment of a Jewish, moral democracy. These parents are leaving the stage, leaving their children and grandchildren in the hands of leaders who have nothing to propose other than blood, sweat and tears.

A deafening silence

"Community and Conscience: The Jews in Apartheid South Africa" by Gideon Shimoni, published by Brandeis University Press/University Press of New England and David Philip, $32.79

Most of South Africa's Jews originated from Lithuania and stepped from oppression there into a society in which their "white" skin color instantly and automatically made them oppressors. They became part of the white minority that ruled over the black majority.

How the Litvaks - and the Jewish immigrants from Britain who preceded them, and the refugees from Nazi Germany who came later - dealt with this dramatic shift in their lives is the subject of Prof. Gideon Shimoni's book. It is an extension of his earlier work, published 23 years ago, on the Jewish community up to 1967. South African-born, he heads the Hebrew University's Institute of Contemporary Jewry. He now takes the story through the darkest period of apartheid rule, through its collapse and into the present.

The Lithuanians came in their thousands late in the 19th century and into the 20th century. (Why to that far-off place in the African sun? Dr. Riva Krut, in an unpublished Ph.D. thesis, says that an enterprising owner of passenger ships used a network of travel agents in Eastern Europe to sell immigration to South Africa so as to fill his vessels.) They brought their misnagdi religious tradition (that is, opposition to Hasidism), already weakened by secularization in the Old Country and now, in the transfer to the new country, further diminished by the imperative of earning a living. Combined with existing Anglo-Jewry practices it led, for much of the community, to what has been called "nonobservant Orthodox."

The Litvaks also imported their imbued sense of Zionism. Over the years it meant that South African Jews led the world in per capita donations to Israel. In 1950, when the community numbered 110,000, no less than 50,000 of them over the age of 18 bought "shekel" memberships in the World Zionist Organization.

Hard-working, putting a premium on education and enjoying the benefits of privileged whites, Jews forged ahead in industry, commerce, mining and the professions, taking on an importance out of all proportion to their numbers. Then came 1948 and the election victory of the Afrikaner Nationalists. A shudder went through the community: The Nationalists had a record of anti-Semitism and had been responsible for restrictions on Jewish immigration in the 1930s; Jews were debarred from membership in the party's leading Transvaal province; Nazi supporters were in the Nationalists' ranks and had been interned during World War II; and the new minister of economic affairs, Eric Louw, was known as "South Africa's Goebbels" because of his anti- Semitism, propaganda methods and physical appearance.

Running scared

As it turned out, the Nationalists quickly made their peace with the Jews. They needed them. During the coming decades there was the occasional muttered threatening warning from government leaders, either out of anger at anti-apartheid actions of individual Jews, or because of Israeli voting at the United Nations. Occasionally, financial remittances to Israel were curtailed. On the floor of Parliament there was incessant anti-Semitic sniping at some Jewish MPs. And Afrikaans newspapers used a clearly Jewish "Hoggenheimer" cartoon character to symbolize capitalist control - derived from the real-life Oppenheimer family, Jewish-born (but converted to Christianity), who dominated the country's economy.

But otherwise, little or nothing. Yet the Jewish leadership ran scared. As the Nationalists embarked on driving racial segregation laws into every nook and cranny of society, beating down on anyone who stood in their way, the Jewish Board of Deputies embraced a careful hands-off policy. A resolution said that "Jews participate in South African public life as citizens of South Africa and have no collective attitude to the political issues which citizens are called upon to decide ... Jews share with their fellow citizens of other faiths and origins a common interest in and responsibility for our country's affairs and participate in them according to their individual convictions."

The rabbis, with only a handful of exceptions, were even more silent. As Shimoni points out, there was not even an attempt to match Jewish behavior with Jewish ethics. Hungarian-born Andre Ungar, a rabbi in the small Reform sector, was one of the exceptions. He condemned apartheid in emphatic terms - and in 1956 the government withdrew his residence permit. The Board of Deputies and Reform leaders looked the other way. This leads Shimoni to the indictment: "No incident better illustrates the fearful and timorous mind-set of the Jewish communal leadership, lay and religious ... "

That tough judgment is on page 38. By page 267, Shimoni writes in defense of the community. It was a minority group, he notes. The "intimidating legacy of Afrikaner nationalist anti-Semitism had been a determining factor in the behavior of the Jewish leadership and outweighed all liberal pangs of conscience." Basically, by adopting a nonpolitical stance, the leaders had behaved responsibly in protecting the interests of their community. And they were backed by the majority of Jews.

Shimoni's harshest condemnation is not directed at the community, but at a young Jewish journalist, Claudia Braude, who six years ago expressed her pain and anger about the behavior of Jewish leaders under apartheid. She mentioned in particular Dr. Percy Yutar, who had held high government judicial office and was the prosecutor in the trial in which Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment. For some dozen years, Yutar was at the same time the elected head of the United Hebrew Congregation, Johannesburg's group of Orthodox synagogues.

Braude's "judgmental posture reflects the retrospective post-apartheid view of one who had grown up well after the period of high apartheid," says Shimoni. Her views, "however well-intentioned, appear to be no more than the self-righteous harangue of a post-apartheid youngster insufficiently mature to appreciate the universal phenomenon of minority-group behavior."

That comment is the crux of this book. Was the Jewish community's silence indeed as excusable as Shimoni maintains? This writer disagrees. Obviously, no one can ever be totally sure of what might have happened, but it can be argued that Jewish fears were exaggerated. Even with full knowledge of their anti-Semitic background, it was inconceivable that the Nationalists would have gone any further than perhaps, at most, curtailing money for Israel. They simply could not afford to add to their problems at home and abroad, by punitive action against the Jews.

Nor, these days, is this assessment a lonely one. Jewish leaders, at least in private conversations, admit their shame and embarrassment about the community's pusillanimity under apartheid. Who will publicly defend Percy Yutar these days? That he was an elected Jewish leader for so many years, while serving as a Security Police tool for repression, is an indelible stain on South Africa's Jews. (And let me declare my personal interest, and special knowledge: I was among Yutar's targets and have first-hand knowledge of his zealous, immoral work for the apartheid government).

More left, less Jewish

The paradox of South Africa's Jews was that, on the one hand, their strong involvement in industry and commerce made them pillars of the apartheid state and they benefited as much as other whites from the system. They could, safely, have circumvented apartheid restrictions by, for example, recognizing a trade union for their black workers, or they could have pushed training programs to increase productivity and hence have gone above poverty levels of pay. But, as far as is known, only a few did so. Only later, in the late 1970s, when black resistance began to mount, did many Jewish - and other - businessmen take fright and begin to take positive action for their workers.

On the other hand, Jews were on the left wing also out of all proportion to their numbers. As an example, five whites were among the underground resistance leaders caught by police at their Rivonia headquarters; all were Jews. Generally, the more Jews moved to the left, the less Jewish they were or became. Should one have expected Jews to line up as a matter of course as Jews in the anti-apartheid camp? While "many white liberals and radicals were Jews, it is equally correct that not many Jews were liberals or radicals," says Shimoni. He says, too, that "it would be nothing short of absurd to argue that people who are avowedly believing Jews and observant of Judaism's precepts, yet hold conservative political convictions, are a less authentic expression of Judaism than others who are liberals or radicals, but reject Judaism's primary beliefs and precepts."

Shimoni's view must raise eyebrows. South Africa wasn't about conservative versus liberal convictions, but about elementary right versus wrong. Whether left-wingers accepted or rejected Judaism was irrelevant. Crude racism and oppression made apartheid South Africa the pariah of the world. Can it really be said that Judaism did not have to have a clear and consistent stand?

Shimoni examines the lives of a number of left-wing Jews, both communists and liberals, searching for reasons to explain why they were as they were. He decides that there is no support for a "Judaic values" theory. "The individual differences between Jewish radicals are myriad. Levels of identifiable Jewish substance in their upbringing and awareness vary considerably, and no generalization can cover every single case." His final conclusion is that "although there is nothing in this [community's] record deserving of moral pride, neither does it warrant utter self-reproach. From a coldly objective historical perspective, this was characteristic minority-group behavior - a phenomenon of self-preservation, performed at the cost of moral righteousness."

Groundless fears

Some will view that as overly charitable. The ultimate judgment of Jewish behavior is perhaps better seen in the present: In democratic South Africa, the community brushes its apartheid past under the rug. It's a standing joke that it is impossible these days to find any white, or Jew, who actually supported apartheid. Instead, Jews who fought against apartheid and who were once feared and kept at a distance, are honored (in public, whatever mutterings might go on behind the scenes).

In the era since the end of apartheid in 1994, the community has found that its trepidation about the coming to power of the African National Congress has proved groundless. Jews play a natural part in government, holding posts as senior as the chief justice and membership in the cabinet. The ANC in exile was befriended by the Palestine Liberation Organization and the close links have endured; at the same time, the government keeps friendly relations with Israel and has tried in a small way to foster peace here.

The community was fortunate in its choice, in 1988, of British-born Cyril Harris as chief rabbi. A "veritable gift," as Shimoni describes him, he has been a noteworthy moral force, drawing wide respect and helping Jews to cope with change. The community and Israel have also benefited from two particular ambassadors - Dr. Alon Liel, who was not only a driving influence inside the Foreign Ministry in redirecting Israel's policy on South Africa, but was the emissary there during the transition to democracy; and the present ambassador, Tova Herzl (she retires this month). Both have positively affected non-Jewish South African attitudes toward the Jewish state.

Meanwhile, Jews have the same anxieties as other South Africans and at this stage that means horrendous crime. It seems to be the chief factor in emigration. From a high of an estimated 120,000 members 30 years ago, the community now numbers about 90,000 - and dropping (some put the figure at less than 70,000). The traditional Zionism has not, however, persuaded Jews to immigrate to Israel. In the 1970s, Israel was the destination of the largest percentage of emigrants. By the 1990s, this had dropped to 15 percent. Most prefer Australia and the United States.

Many of those who remain behind find a haven in religious orthodoxy.

Arafat: Israel trying to scupper road map
By The Associated Press	and Haaretz Service	| Dec. 31, 2003 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on Wednesday accused the Israeli government of doing all it could to scupper the internationally-brokered road map to Middle East peace, Army Radio reported. He charged that the government in Jerusalem was not interested in returning to the negotiating table, the report said.

The radio quoted Arafat, in a speech to mark the 39th anniversary of the establishment of his Fatah movement, as saying that the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was worse than the apartheid regime in South Africa.

He also appealed to the "peace camp" in Israel, urging it to take a more active role in internal Israeli affairs.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the Gaza Strip on Wednesday to mark the 39th anniversary of the formation of Arafat's Fatah movement.

In an unusual show of support for the veteran Palestinian leader in a place where Hamas is popular, people wore shirts emblazoned with Arafat's image and vowed their eternal support.

"The Palestinian message to the world is very clear: Palestinians will remain those who decide on war or peace, and Yasser Arafat is the leader of peace and war," said a Fatah gunman who identified himself only as Nabil.

Hundreds of Palestinians, including a group of boy scouts, also packed into Arafat's Muqata compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah to show support and celebrate the event.

<title>'Anti-apartheid-like sanctions needed for Iran'</title>
<date>23/1/2007</date>
<content>
Republican Mitt Romney, a possible candidate for US president in 2008, called for economic sanctions against Iran "at least as severe" as those imposed on South Africa during its apartheid era, in an effort to convince Iran to give up its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

Addressing a security conference in Israel, the former Massachusetts governor also urged states to divest in Iran.

He said pursuing nuclear weapons "can also be a source of peril" for Iran.

"The military option remains on the table," said a text of the remarks Romney delivered Tuesday at the seventh annual Herzliya Conference in Herzliya, Israel. He was one of several potential candidates to address the conference.

<title>Bar-Ilan again forced to deal with the extremists in its midst</title>
<date>16/8/2007</date>
<content>
Bar-Ilan University is under media scrutiny for the second time in less than a week, after extreme political comments voiced by members of its teaching staff.

But as it severs its ties with the professor at the center of the latest flare-up, the university also insists that by employing staff from both the far-right and far-left, it is serving as a "bridge" for diverse sectors of society.

The latest incident, which actually took place three months ago but was only uncovered Wednesday, came days after comments by Bar-Ilan Hebrew literature professor Hillel Weiss brought down an avalanche of negative media scrutiny on the school in Ramat Gan.

Weiss wished death to Hebron Brigade commander Col. Yehuda Fuchs, who aided in the evacuation of two Jewish families, including Weiss's own daughter, son-in-law and six grandchildren, from the Arab market in Hebron on August 8.

In the latest incident, Dr. Yair Wiseman, of the university's computer science department, rebuked and punished a student for taking part in the Gaza disengagement. Wiseman initially refused to grant the student a technical request. As part of the rejection response, Wiseman also harangued the student because he "perpetrated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza."

"T," a reserve officer in the IDF who was pursuing a double major of economics and computer science at the university, was unable to take a test during the 2005 school year due to his participation in disengagement.

Directly following the pullout, T took a one-year leave from his studies to travel abroad. Upon returning, less than a year ago, he asked to make up the test by doing a work task instead.

However, Wiseman refused, arguing it was against academic regulations. Wiseman ended the missive by rebuking T:

"On April 30, 1975," the professor wrote, "North Vietnam conquered Saigon in the south without firing a shot. The army expelled all the residents who were without employment and without livelihood. The expulsion of Saigon's residents is considered to this day one of the most embarrassing war crimes in human history.

"I find it difficult to differentiate between the crimes committed in Vietnam in 1975 and the ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the IDF in the summer of 2005. A moral human being does not behave like a robot and realizes that there are limits to military authority.

"I am surprised that you are so proud of taking part in that organized crime."

T submitted an additional request to Wiseman, this time with a copy and a complaint to computer science department head Prof. Amihud Amir. Wiseman continued to reject T's request, though he eventually bowed to pressure from Amir and other senior university figures.

"I am sorry to see that you still do not understand the severity of the crime you perpetrated," wrote Wiseman. "I assume that you would never murder or rape settlement residents and you would never follow such an order.

"But to throw people out of their homes and destroy the greenhouses that provide them with a livelihood is part of a 'process.' Do you understand what you did?

"I am not a judge, nor am I a law enforcer or a prosecutor. Therefore, I don't decide your punishment. There is a God and He will do it. But from a reading of your letters, of how you serve in the IDF with such loyalty, incenses me. And I do not think I am overreacting."

Wiseman, who is abroad, could not be reached for comment.

Since Yigal Amir, who studied law at Bar-Ilan University, assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, the school has been struggling to shake off the stigma of a radical right-wing university. The comments made by Weiss and the newest incident with Wiseman have again generated bad publicity for the Israeli university with the largest student body.

Aren Maeir, professor of Biblical Archeology at Bar-Ilan who spearheaded a petition that called Weiss's comments "reprehensible and repugnant" and was signed by some 60 of the university professors' and researchers', said Bar-Ilan had a proportionally high number of staff with right-wing opinions.

"There is a higher percentage of teaching staff with Orthodox backgrounds than in other universities. And, in general, Orthodox people tend to be to the right of center," he said. "I am not saying it as a scientific position but I would say there is a higher than average representation of right-wing opinions here.

"Despite that, my experience has been that both the student body and teaching staff have always maintained non-vitriolic discourse."

Bar-Ilan also has several staff members with strong left-wing views. For instance, Dr. Kobi Snitz of the mathematics department is active in the weekly anti-security barrier demonstrations in Bili'in, near Modi'in, which regularly deteriorate into violent clashes between border policemen and a coalition of left-wing activists from Europe, Palestinians and "anarchist" Israelis. Another Bar-Ilan teacher is Dr. Menachem Klein, who called Israel's policy of using the security barrier as a means of protection against terrorism "'Spartheid' - apartheid through the arguments and means employed by Greek Sparta."

Meanwhile, Ariel Toaff, a professor of Medieval Jewish history, recently created his own share of negative media buzz for Bar-Ilan by publishing a book in Italian called Passovers of Blood: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders that gave credence to anti-Semitic blood libels.

According to media reports, the book, which experts said was based on faulty research, stated that some Christian children may have been killed by "a minority of fundamentalist Jews of Ashkenazi origin."

"We are a bridge for very diverse groups in Israeli society," said Bar-Ilan spokesman Shmuel Elgrably. "That's why it is so easy for people to attach a stigma to us. The Left attacks us because we have people like Weiss in our staff, while the Right attacks us because of our left-wing professors."

Prof. Moshe Koppel, a member of Bar-Ilan's computer science department, said in response to the criticism leveled against Wiseman that it was legitimate for a university lecturer to be allowed to express strong political opinions without having to fear professional or criminal repercussions.

"But at the same time, students are political animals who should not be subjected to the overbearing authority of their professor in such matters," said Koppel.

"It is important to understand that Wiseman granted the student's request. It is unfortunate that he made those additional comments, which were, in his view, just a way of letting off steam."

University spokesman Elgrably said that the university's rector, after confronting Wiseman's unwillingness to apologize for mixing his political opinions with his academic work, decided that Wiseman would not continue to work in the coming year at Bar-Ilan.

<title>Bibi optimistic about stopping Iran</title>
<date>21/1/2007</date>
<content>
Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu opened the Herzliya Conference on the Balance of National Security with an optimistic prognosis about the nation's future and the ability of the international community to prevent the nuclearization of Iran.

Speaking at a luncheon at Herzliya's Daniel Hotel, Netanyahu surprised people who were expecting him to present a frightening picture of the threats to Israel as he did when he compared Iran to Nazi Germany ahead of Hitler's rise in his November speech to the United Jewish Communities General Assembly in Los Angeles.

"I am optimistic, and it's not baseless, because I understand our abilities, and with the right leadership, we can overcome our crises and reach better days," Netanyahu said.

Netanyahu outlined a series of steps that he believes could contribute to preventing a nuclear Iran, either without a military strike or by creating the international legitimacy for such a strike to take place.

The first step Netanyahu suggested was to encourage countries and companies around the world to enforce voluntary economic sanctions against Iran. He said that if the American pension funds stopped investing in 70 companies that do business with Iran, it would deal a serious blow to the country's economy.

"With the right work, we can make [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad's regime unacceptable to the world and close almost all the world's doors to him," Netanyahu said. "There should be voluntary sanctions with teeth without waiting for the United Nations. It worked against the apartheid government of South Africa, and the same thing can work against the genocidal regime of Iran."

The second step Netanyahu recommended was the international effort to convict Ahmadinejad of the Geneva Convention's clause on incitement to genocide. Netanyahu will speak at the British House of Commons on Thursday, accompanied by the initiators of the drive, Likud MK Dan Naveh and Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs head Dore Gold.

Netanyahu did not elaborate on the military option but he said that Israel should be leading the international effort to prevent the nuclearization of Iran, using diplomatic, legal and financial means.

"The world that didn't stop the Holocaust last time can stop it this time if they divest from genocide," Netanyahu said. "Who will lead the effort against genocide if not us? The world will not stand up on behalf of the Jews if the Jews do not stand up on behalf of the world."

Netanyahu attacked Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government, saying that it doesn't help the country that "there are new diplomatic plans every morning from every minister and deputy minister."

Netanyahu claimed credit for predicting the negative outcome of the Gaza Strip disengagement and warned against future withdrawals in the West Bank.

Nevertheless, he said that if the Hamas government in the Palestinian Authority was toppled, Israel could negotiate with new Palestinian leaders based on reciprocity.

Netanyahu ended the address by calling for a "new spirit" of patriotism, telling the world and educating Israeli children that justice is on Israel's side.

<title>Bumpy Ride</title>
<date>26/4/2007</date>
<content>
Drivers are cursing it, future train riders are waiting for it impatiently, and although the light rail line is a work in progress (scheduled to be opened only in 2009), one can already feel that the legendary Jerusalem light railway is about to become a reality quite soon.

"The groundwork is completed, so is the construction of the first two train carriages," reports Shmuel Elgrabli, media director of the Light Rail Project.

Last week the first segment of the spectacular suspension bridge was lifted up above the entrance to the city. The bridge was designed by Santiago Calatrava, an award-winning Spanish architect who is currently working on the future train station/World Trade Center transportation hub at Ground Zero in New York. The light railway line will connect the northern neighborhoods of Pisgat Ze'ev and Neveh Ya'acov with Sderot Herzl, with stops in Shuafat, French Hill, the American Colony, Musrara, along Jaffa Road, Kiryat Moshe, Beit Hakerem and Mount Herzl. The state-of-the-art transportation system is scheduled to open January 5, 2009. A bus line from Derech Hebron to Ramot, the first of four to five lines supporting high-grade buses, is planned to open at the same time.

One of the project's major aims is to allow residents from all part of the city to reach the center quickly, without encountering the traffic snarls that have become all-too common.

"The center is the biggest place of commerce and work, so it must be easily accessible in order to grow," says Asaf Vitman, CEO of Eden, a municipal sub-group focused on the renewal of the city center. New parking lots and improved traffic patterns are also part of the plan.

"In Jerusalem it was clear that the transportation infrastructure was hampering life in the center; the new light rail train will drastically improve the situation," adds Dr. Daniel Felsenstein, director of the Institute for Urban and Regional Studies at the Hebrew University.

Until recently, many Jerusalemites, veterans and newcomers alike, were skeptical about the chances of the Jerusalem light railway taking off. Some were even making bets about it, laughing about the improbability of this project.

"Finally, Jerusalem will have decent transportation. It's about time we had a railway. I personally have heard of this project since the day I came to live in Israel, which was in 1991," says Mira Gershkovitz, who came to Jerusalem from St. Petersburg, a city that is served by a light rail system.

Gershkovitz doesn't have a driver's license, and she finds Egged buses to be both uncomfortable and inefficient. "The way they drive here, it's impossible for an old woman to stay on her feet. I have fallen more then once on a bus, but the driver didn't even apologize. And you never know how long you will have to wait for a bus. I hope it will be different with the train."

Her daughter Sophia, who lives in Neveh Ya'acov, adds that if the railway proves to be effective, she will consider selling her car and switching to public transportation.

JUST LIKE any other issue that relates to the Holy City, a light rail in the capital is much more than steel tracks laid on the ground and colorful carriages that drive around the city. Pro-Palestinian groups all over Europe call it "the apartheid train," claiming that it will cause the Arab population of east Jerusalem to be further alienated from the city, and that it "illegally" connects the city center with the "illegal settlements" of Pisgat Ze'ev and Neveh Ya'acov. They also claim the railway will run through "occupied territory" and that it will serve as some kind of a border in the future. The Jerusalem railway was discussed by the French government, the heads of the Arab League and the Islamic Conference Organization.

The east Jerusalem population seems to be pessimistic about the light rail. "Simaya," a resident of Shuafat (who requested anonymity), says she isn't holding her breath about the new transportation system. "I heard that the train will stop at Shuafat, but I won't believe it until I see it. Right now we, Jews and Arabs, have different buses, and we do not meet on public transport. So do you really think it will happen on their precious train? I don't see how," she says.

Manal, a student at David Yellin College, is hopeful that the train will serve all the residents of Jerusalem equally, because then she will have a very comfortable commute from Shuafat to Sderot Herzl, but she is not sure that this will actually happen.

Many residents of east Jerusalem neighborhoods that will be on the route are just as skeptical as Simaya and Manal about the railway; some are still doubtful as to whether the project will ever become a reality.

"Who knows if it will even be completed? The Palestinian press often writes that the international community disapproves of this project, since the train will pass through east Jerusalem," says Samer Ismail, a Hebrew University student who lives in Beit Hanina.

Murad Kabha, a bus driver from Shuafat, believes that the idea of a railway in Jerusalem is positive as a whole, but that in the current political circumstances it's doomed to fail. "The train will pass through our lands and our neighborhoods, but it certainly will not stop there, just wait and see. The Israeli authorities are doing everything in their power to estrange the Palestinians from their lands and to banish them from Jerusalem. I'm sure that due to security arrangements, Shuafat and Beit Hanina residents won't be able to ride the train. The route will be changed or stations canceled - they will find a way. Eventually, just those who live in Pisgat Ze'ev and Neveh Ya'acov will benefit from this project."

WHILE JERUSALEMITES in both parts of the city are waiting for the train to actually begin service and then can decide whether or not it serves their needs, many organizations and movements in Europe and the Arab world are trying to cancel the project, even as the groundwork is under way.

In 2002, the tender for the â‚¬400 million contract for the construction of the light rail system was won by the CityPass consortium, consisting of domestic investors Polar Investments, Ashtrom Ltd. and Harel Insurance Investments, and Paris-based transport giants Alstom and CGEA-Connex. The involvement of French companies in the project was immediately condemned by French pro-Palestinian groups such as Association France Palestine Solidarit  and others as "shameful and embarrassing."

A statement issued by the association in 2004 says that "the train breaks the international laws that forbid building and constructing in the occupied territories and creates a new permanent reality in east Jerusalem, connecting the illegal settlements with the city center."

In October 2005 Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas raised the issue during his meeting with French President Jacques Chirac. Shortly afterward the French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, sent a message to the Association France Palestine Solidarit : "Private companies bidding for international tenders in no way reflect a change in France's well-known stance on Jerusalem," referring to France's commitment to the international status of Jerusalem and consistent position on the settlements issue.

Amnon Kapeluk, Le Monde Diplomatique correspondent in Israel, says that "the official France is rather embarrassed by the whole ordeal. It would rather not have these two companies involved in the project, but since we are talking about the private sector, there is nothing much that the French authorities can do about it."

Kapeluk quoted a French source who told him that the matter was explained to the heads of the two companies, but since the government can't interfere with private sector activity, their involvement in the project continues. That, adds Kapeluk, doesn't indicate any change in the official French position.

While Paris is unable or unwilling to interfere, the Association France Palestine Solidarit  decided to take matters into its own hands and took the two companies to court, claiming that "the project is aimed at connecting the illegal settlements in east Jerusalem and the western part."

The lawsuit is based on a clause in French law that allows the court to cancel any agreement that could violate public peace and good intentions, the group says. The heads of the association are asking the court to annul all the contracts between Connex, Ashtrom and Israel. No date for a hearing has yet been set.

MEANWHILE, IN Ireland, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign has claimed some success in applying pressure to the Irish transportation company Veolia, which is part of the French group Connex. The Bethlehem-based Maan news agency reported on March 17 that "Israel had been holding negotiations with Veolia to train Israeli engineers and drivers on the Dublin Luas tram line system. But Irish trade union representatives, in response to the IPSC, exerted pressure on Veolia to withdraw from the proposed project.

British charity War on Want reported an IPSC spokesperson as saying that: 'This is a small but significant victory for the Palestinian right to self-determination. This tramline, like the apartheid wall, is an integral component of Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem. You would expect a tramline to be fairly innocuous, but the lesson is no: When you do business with Israel, you invariably do business with the occupation. Veolia clearly understand that there is a growing awareness of this within Irish society. People are realizing that diplomacy has utterly failed to curb Israeli crimes. We must cut ties with Israel in order to force it to end its occupation.'"

David Landy, one of the activists from the IPSC, told In Jerusalem by phone from Ireland that "Israel is breaking international laws in regards to the occupied territories, and foreign companies shouldn't support this violation."

Answering a question on whether the residents of east Jerusalem may also benefit from the railway, considering that it may be the ideal transportation solution for this part of the town as well, Landy said that "we are not against a light rail in Jerusalem per se, however only if the Palestinians ratify this project, which they didn't, can we agree to it."

The heads of Veolia, however, claim that the contract's cancellation had nothing to do with political pressure. The spokeswoman of the company told IJ that "Veolia accommodated three visits of Israeli delegations to Ireland, but the company's depot is not suitable for this kind of training. We do not provide it for any other country either."

Landy believes that Veolia's declaration is only designed to save face. "They would say that. But it fact, they took the decision after being pressured by the trade unions with whom we work jointly," he comments.

Meanwhile, the Hague-based ASN Bank has been much more overt about the issue. The bank recently divested its holdings in Veolia Transport, explaining that the project "is not in line with the United Nations' demand to stop all support for Israel's settlement activities."

The bank, together with the major Dutch non-governmental donor organization Interchurch Organization for Development Cooperation and the Amsterdam-based NGO A Different Jewish Voice, urged the multinational corporation to end its involvement in the light rail project.

Veolia replied that it was looking into the matter. "ASN Bank's criteria are not met by that answer," the bank responded. As a result, it decided to divest its shares in Veolia.

SPOKESMAN ELGRABLI believes that the cancellation of a training course in Ireland is not such a big deal. "Sometimes a train is just a train," he says, stressing that the company abides by international law and is against the polarization of the issue.

"There is no problem at all. The international companies continue to work, the French government has approved the project and is satisfied with it, and we continue to make progress... The train will benefit the entire population of Jerusalem, there is no doubt about it. As for the attempt of some groups and organizations to interrupt our work by putting pressure on some parties - it's a pathetic move, and it won't work," he concludes.

Meanwhile, as a result of the pressure in Ireland, Israeli train drivers will not be trained by Veolia there. "It is no problem to find suitable training for the drivers in Europe or elsewhere," Elgrabli explains and adds, "You can be sure that these drivers will get the training."

<title>Comment: The start of a civil marriage revolution? Not quite</title>
<date>19/7/2007</date>
<content>
At first glance, the proposed legislation approved by Chief Sephardi Rabbi Shlomo Amar to allow civil marriages in Israel - in cases where both bride and groom are not halachically Jewish - seems to be a great step forward on the road to eventual acceptance of non-sectarian marriages.

Hailed by some as the first of its kind or a "groundbreaking" decision that would also manage to maintain the status quo, the announcement even made headlines on prime time TV news shows Wednesday night and took up valuable front page space in most daily newspapers the next day.

However, critics say that a closer inspection of this supposed historic declaration reveals that it will help only a very small minority of people - basically those who call themselves atheists or those non-Jews who do not wish to be married in a religious ceremony - navigate past the bureaucracy and autocracy of Orthodox control over lifecycle events.

Some say it will produce many more problems than it intends to solve. The most obvious complication is the creation of a separate class of people allowed to live within a nation, but who are not entitled to the same social rights as the rest of the population.

Moreover, they warn, the law, which discourages integration of those with questionable Jewish heritage into mainstream Jewish-Israeli society, might also mean losing out on thousands of potential mixed families that could, down the line, return fully to halachic Judaism.

Irit Rosenblum, director of New Family, an organization that advocates the rights of alternative families in Israel, estimated that the law will help only about 5-8 percent of the 300,000 non-Jews currently living in Israel.

"This new law has no effect on us," commented one Filipino woman, who is planning to marry her Filipino boyfriend in the near future. "We can have a civil marriage at the Filipino embassy or get married in one of the churches in Jaffa."

Furthermore, Rosenblum said that New Family already encourages couples of mixed religious backgrounds turned down for marriage by the Rabbinate to join in union via a legally binding document processed through the court system. Already 8,000 couples have been married this way, she said.

"They [the rabbinate and the government] are trying to sell us the idea that this is a big step," she said, adding that "it is just making a joke of all the work that we have done in recent years to establish a system of civil marriage in Israel."

Ludmilla Oigenblick, executive director of The Association of Mixed Families' Rights, is far harsher in her criticism of the new law. She emphasized that in actual fact it will contribute to building a new underclass in society whereby non-Jews are not allowed to marry Jews.

"This law sends a message to those not considered halachically Jewish that they are not welcomed in our society," she said, adding that a large proportion of those not recognized by the Rabbinate are in fact Jewish on their father's side.

"This is a racist law," concurred Rosenblum. "It's a form of apartheid. We are not just making racist comments but we are actually investigating people's backgrounds and making decisions for them based on that."

"This new law is not a solution, for many people it is really a barrier to gaining access to Israeli society," added Oigenblick. "If allowed to marry Jews, these people could eventually produce children that are halachically Jewish."

<title>Court petitioned over travel with Palestinians</title>
<date>7/1/2007</date>
<content>
Eight human rights organizations petitioned the High Court of Justice on Sunday against the military order forbidding Israelis and foreigners from traveling in the same car with Palestinians inside the West Bank.

The order, issued last month by OC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Yair Naveh, is due to go into effect on January 19. The petitioners, represented by Michael Sfard, charged that "the order is the foundation of a legal process of systematic, institutional discrimination. It is being issued in the context of deepening control of one nationality over another and fulfills the criteria for defining apartheid."

<title>Dugard may probe Israeli 'apartheid' in territories</title>
<date>16/3/2007</date>
<content>
The United Nation's Human Rights Council is looking to appoint John Dugard as a permanent investigator on Israel's actions in the territories, which he has in the past compared to apartheid, Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Yitzhak Levanon, told The Jerusalem Post on Thursday.

Levanon said the appointment would be part of a move to create a mandate by which to permanently probe Israeli violations of international law in the territories until such time as Israel withdraws to the pre-1967 border.

A proposal to this effect has been presented to the Council by the Organization of the Islamic Conference but it does not mention Dugard, who published a report on the territories in January. No decision has been taken on the matter so far. The report is slated for discussion by the council next week.

Dugard, a prominent South African professor of international law, has served as a judge on the International Court of Justice and as "special rapporteur" for both the UN Commission on Human Rights and the International Law Commission. He is considered an expert on apartheid.

In the report, Dugard said: "The international community has identified three regimes as inimical to human rights - colonialism, apartheid and foreign occupation. Israel is clearly in military occupation of the occupied Palestinian territories. At the same time elements of the occupation constitute forms of colonialism and of apartheid, which are contrary to international law."

He suggested that the issue of Israeli actions in the territories be brought before the International Court of Justice.

Levanon told the Post he considered it "likely" that the council would in fact appoint Dugard to permanently probe Israeli actions in the territories. He said the move was biased against Israel and one-sided in that the investigatory mandate limited itself only to Israeli actions and did not explore Palestinian violations of international law and human rights issues.

The UN body was created in June to replace the Human Rights Commission, which was scrapped because it had a faulty membership composition and repeatedly singled out Israel.

But since its inception, the 47-member body - which includes Cuba, Saudi Arabia and China - has continued to single out the Jewish state. It has issued eight anti-Israel resolutions, and none against any other nation. It has also held three special sessions on Israel.

In speaking with the Post, Levanon said that this new council "is worse than the old commission."

He added that based on its actions so far in the fourth session which opened Monday and is scheduled to run until April 5, the council has continued it pattern of "singling out Israel."

In speaking before the council on Thursday, Levanon also protested its to recreate some of the discriminatory language used in the old commission to reference Israel and to place it in a category separate from other countries on the issue of "human rights abuses."

In addressing the council in Geneva, Levanon said: "One of the primary reasons behind the demise of the old commission was the repeatedly singling-out of one country, the infamous "Article 8." And what do we see before us today? We see mention of the exact same Article 8, as if 60 years of one-sidedness and politicization of the commission were not enough to learn the lesson."

He added that it was a "dark day" for the Council.

In addition, according to Levanon, it is expected that Israel will be rapped for the Antiquities Authority's construction of an access ramp to the Temple Mount's Mughrabi Gate. It is also likely to be taken to task for refusing entry to international inquiry teams in July and in November.

<title>Ethiopian groups to rally against 'apartheid'</title>
<date>11/12/2007</date>
<content>
A wide cross-section of Ethiopian groups is planning to protest Wednesday in Petah Tikva against what is sees as a policy of apartheid adopted by the education system specifically and Israeli society in general.

The demonstration, which is set to kick off at 10 a.m. opposite the town's municipal building, is to express the community's anger over the revelation last week that a Petah Tikva school had been keeping four Ethiopian second-grade pupils separate from the rest of the student body.

"This phenomenon of apartheid by the education system should be a cause of concern to all the Israeli public and not just the Ethiopian community," commented Avraham Neguise, head of a coalition of Ethiopian groups in Israel. "As Jews, we moved here to be part of Israeli society and not to be kept separate."

Among those expected to participate in the rally are Ethiopian community spiritual leaders, heads of community welfare organizations, students, Knesset Members and any one who believes in justice, wrote Neguise in a statement.

<title>Ethiopian protesters demand end to 'apartheid'</title>
<date>12/12/2007</date>

Thousands of protesters gathered Wednesday outside the Petah Tikva Municipality to express their anger at what is perceived by many as a policy of "apartheid" against Ethiopian students within the local education system and to call on the town's mayor, Yitzhak Ohayon, to resign.

The rally followed the revelation last week that a Petah Tikva-area school had been keeping four second-grade pupils separate from the rest of the student body during class time and recess.

"We are fighting for equality and integration in Israeli society and against segregation in the education system and kindergartens," Avraham Neguise, head of the coalition of Ethiopian organizations in Israel, told The Jerusalem Post. "We expect the mayor Yitzhak Ohayon to resign from his job, or at the very least to dismiss the principal responsible for such a policy."

In response, a spokesman for Ohayon said that the mayor was disappointed that Ethiopian leaders had not approached him directly to discuss the issue.

"To date, he [Ohayon] has been on their side and has even stopped funding to the Lamerhav School [which it partially supports]," he said, adding "They should take their protest to the government and not to the town of Petah Tikva, a place that is known for its acceptance of new immigrants and for investing in immigrant absorption."

At the rally, Avi Masfin, spokesman for the Israeli Association of Ethiopian Jews, commented that discrimination and racism happen across Israel and that the case in Petah Tikva is only one example.

"The Education Ministry tries to hide these cases from us, but we are calling on everyone in our community to speak out about what is happening," he said. "When it happens to the older generation we can keep quiet but when there is discrimination against our children, many of whom were born here and are Israeli in every sense, we cannot sit still."

Both Neguise and Masfin said they were disappointed by the fact that none of the country's politicians showed up to support their cause and that not more Israeli-born citizens joined the rally.

"This phenomenon of apartheid by the education system should be a cause of concern to all the Israeli public and not just the Ethiopian community," said Neguise, adding that government plans to end aliya from Ethiopia within the next year sends a negative message to the Israeli public that the community is "not welcome here."

"As Jews we moved here to be part of Israeli society and not to be kept separate," he said.

Meanwhile, the Knesset Committees for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs and for Education, Culture and Sports held an emergency session Wednesday morning to discuss the Petah Tikva school incident and other cases of segregation within the education system.

"I am ashamed of the segregation experienced by Ethiopian students at the Lamerhav School," commented MK Michael Melchior (Labor), chair of the Committee for Education, Culture and Sports. "This phenomenon has become a stain on Israeli society. The message of discrimination starts from above."

Most Ethiopian immigrants currently arriving in Israel are Falash Mura - descendants of Jews forced to convert to Christianity more than a century ago.

Because there is a question mark surrounding their Jewishness according to Halacha, they are forced to undergo an Orthodox Jewish conversion. During the conversion period, which can take up to two years, the children must attend national religious schools.

The committee called on the government to try to reduce the number of Ethiopian pupils placed in the religious school system and requested a complete revision of legislation that "allows racism against Ethiopian immigrants to continue in Orthodox schools."

Knesset members at the meeting, including Ronit Tirosh (Kadima), Silvan Shalom (Likud), Zevulun Orlev (NRP) and Yoel Hasson (Kadima), noted that another issue in the process of Ethiopian immigrant absorption was that of the limited mortgage package handed out by the government, which forces the new immigrants to purchase property in low-income neighborhoods creating "ghettos" in certain cities.

"If we don't distribute the Ethiopian population into stronger neighborhoods, we will never find a solution to end the discrimination," said Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs Committee chairman MK Michael Nudelman, who also called on the government to immediately change its policy of absorption to allow the correct distribution of new immigrants into all neighborhoods.

The committee also demanded that the Education Ministry set up a committee to look into the Lamerhav School incident. Ohayon also attended the meeting.

<title>For the Russian community, fears of stigma worsen</title>
<date>11/9/2007</date>
<content>
Two days after police announced they had uncovered a neo-Nazi ring in Petah Tikva composed of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Russian olim have expressed fears that sabras will hold their community collectively responsible.

"People are scared that native-born Israelis will believe that all Russians are anti-Zionist and hold Nazi sentiments or support these people," said Yoav Prokofiev, who heads the Israeli-Russian Internet portal Zahav.ru and runs one of the largest Israeli-Russian blogs (botinok.co.il).

"You can't blame the whole community for this," said Prokofiev. "Even though we are not always accepted by native Israelis here, many of us feel deeply connected to Israel. Some of the people commenting [on the blog] say that these boys must be thrown out of the country for what they have done."

Maxim Reider, a freelance journalist for the Russian-language media, said the case had been overplayed by the Hebrew media and that those who already disapproved of Russian immigrants would simply use the incident as an excuse to "go on hating us."

"Those who did not like us before will now say: 'I told you that [the Russian immigrants] were not Jews,'" Reider said. "However, those who appreciate our community will continue to sympathize with us."

Despite reports in the Hebrew dailies on Monday that neo-Nazi activities were rife across the country, Reider said he doubted this was true.

"I think these neo-Nazi symbols are not something deep and authentic for the most of the kids and I do not believe there are many," he said, adding that while he in no way sympathized with the accused in the Petah Tikva case, he believed the problem had socioeconomic roots.

"The parents [of these children] have lost their status since moving here. They have lost their self-confidence and are raising their children in an empty space," said Reider. "They want to fit in here but are told all the time that they are not Jews."

"We have known about this group for a long time and were just waiting for the police to do something about them," said Prokofiev, who lives in the same Petah Tikva neighborhood as the eight alleged neo-Nazis. "These are children without anything to do all day. There are some serious economic difficulties in this neighborhood and there are many problems."

One woman wrote on Prokofiev's blog that she lives in constant fear in "a neighborhood of crime," not only from immigrant youths but also from other local criminals.

"It's a terrible neighborhood," she wrote. "My own son is too scared to go out and the police do nothing about it."

Michael Ginker, director of immigration and aliya for the Union of Local Authorities, said that of Petah Tikva's 200,000 residents, roughly 21 percent were immigrants, including 38,482 from the FSU.

City council member Genady Borchevsqi, who heads the city's Immigrant Absorption Department and acts as an official representative for the FSU community, told The Jerusalem Post that Petah Tikva was like an "apartheid state, with much racism against the Russian immigrant population," making it difficult for them to integrate.

"There are many problems here and no one is dealing with them," Borchevsqi said.

<title>Gaydamak: The Third Force</title>
<date>18/10/2007</date>
<content>
In order to cut energy costs, the government turned out the light at the end of tunnel, say the Israelis. DÃ©jÃ -vu descended on the political scene, making it so dark that a cat needs a torch to get around. Shop-soiled once-rejected politicians Ehud Barak and Binyamin Netanyahu creep back to power, while Ehud Olmert waits for his turn to be rejected and re-cycled later.

At this low point, a powerful new personality is soaking up much of the waning limelight. You can't open an Israeli newspaper without reading his name; his face looks at you from posters on the streets; every conversation, every Parliamentary hearing or TV debate brings you the man. He is Arcadi Gaydamak, the man who wants to save Israel.

He is an Israeli Ross Perot. A reminder for young people: Ross Perot was the son of a Texas cotton-picker, who "made it" in the data business, became a billionaire and tried to save the US by running for the presidency. In hindsight, it is pity he did not win: Perot was an American patriot of a soft conservative-isolationist ilk; he was for quality education, repairing US cities, against Middle East military adventures and outsourcing. Democrats and Republicans united to bury him and marched to Iraq over his [politically] dead body.

Gaydamak often sounds like Perot, when he attacks Israeli professional politicians for their corruption and lack of concern for ordinary people, and his message is well received - Israelis justifiably hold their politicians in low esteem. The politicians repay him with unmitigated hostility: he succeeds in uniting the Israeli right- and left-wing just as did the Lebanese war. The journalists and reporters are invariably hostile and outright rude to him, never sparing an accusation or innuendo. But he is extremely popular with hoi polloi, with the Sephardi Jews and the poor Jewish Orthodox families of Jerusalem, with non-elite immigrant communities - Moroccans and Russians, and with the Palestinians of Galilee. They like him for his panache, for his generosity and compassion, for his straight talk, but first of all for his sponsorship of soccer teams, of the Jerusalem Sephardi Betar and of the Galilean Arab BneI Sakhnin.

His new party called Social Justice is a new and potentially powerful Third Force in the Israeli political structure. Israeli voters are usually dissatisfied with existing parties (aren't we all?), but (as opposed to the UK and the US) the Israeli election system allows for this dissatisfaction to be expressed in the voting booth. Thus, a third force party broke the long Labour Party rule in 1977, and quite recently a Retirees Party also made considerable inroads. Even the ruling Kadima party is a "third force," positioned between the Labour and Likud. Thus it is quite possible that Mr Gaydamak will find a prominent place at the top, whether in the government or - as he says - at the helm of Jerusalem, where he is extremely popular. Jerusalem could be the starting point for his rise to the Prime Ministership - Ehud Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem to start with. This is right time to sit up and pay attention to the rising Mr Gaydamak, for he is the man who could break the present impasse. He has guts and he has good will and compassion, again like Perot. True, independent candidates are rather unpredictable, but the mainstream candidates are a sure thing - worthless!

Competing parties of the left and right work hard to undermine his legitimacy: he is not an easy man to control; he has an independent mind and he can't be bought. The far right says that he is an Arab-lover (an accusation similar to "nigger-lover" of the Deep South) or a Russian spy sent by Putin, the left claims he does not understand democracy and may turn Israel towards next military confrontation with its neighbours, if allied to Mr Netanyahu. This alarmist view is based on a peculiar vision of the present Israeli leadership as soft-left, pacifist, democratic, and shies away from wars. If you believe this, you'll believe anything, even their next line: that now this wonderful Israeli regime is about to be subverted by Gaydamak who will support Bibi Netanyahu, and these two will march Israel to war with Iran, Syria or Hizbullah, while extinguishing any remaining hope in Israel's peace camp regarding the Palestinians.

All of this is trash. We already had a military confrontation with Hezbullah and with Syria, being led by Olmert with Labor support. Far from being pacifist, this government already had sent the army to Lebanon last year, and last week they also bombed Syria. As for Iran, Olmert's Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, has called for war with Iran repeatedly, at the UN last month as well. Actually Gaydamak offers the best chance for peace in the country and with its neighbours.

The man's origins provide a key to both the elite hostility and the mass popularity. Gaydamak came to Israel in 1972 as an impecunious Russian immigrant who could only hope for low-end temporary jobs. Stagnate and restrictive Israel was not the place for a man on the go, and the dynamic 20-year old moved on to France. After many adventures capped with a LÃ©gion d'honneur ribbon as proof, he "made it," became a billionaire, returned for a while to his native Moscow, and some two years ago came back to Israel.

He took Israel by storm. At first, we saw him as a local boy who made it good elsewhere and came back to show off. An Israeli Great Gatsby, of sorts. Wonderfully dressed, lithe, fast as a tennis player, he established himself in Caesarea, a villa beach community of wealthy aristocrats halfway between Tel Aviv and Haifa, threw a lot of lavish receptions, and generously supported worthy causes.

But Israel is not the US of Scott Fitzgerald days; under its easy-going democratic ways there is the strict authoritarian pecking order of a more primitive tribal society. You are nobody unless you have a lot of Arab scalps under your belt; you are nobody if your father did not serve in Palmach or Irgun, the Zionist guerrilla bands of pre-1948. An impeccable wealthy gentleman with a philanthropic touch would be knighted in modern England; Gaydamak was as soundly rejected by the Israeli upper class as an American upstart in Henry James' novels. Eventually he got in, but this traumatic experience probably influenced his next steps: He did not follow the route of other wealthy Jews who often visit or even settle in Israel - he was not satisfied with his comfortable life at the Mediterranean Sea, with rubbing shoulders in the company of the prime minister, with visiting settlements and military bases, with cutting ribbons and naming buildings after himself, though he did all that. He discovered the illness of Israeli society and began to speak his mind and act, and to act in quite unusual manner.

While Israeli public figures and visiting Jewish businessmen usually compete in ferociously chauvinist rhetoric, Gaydamak struck a completely different tone: he called for equality and prosperity for all citizens, Jews and Arabs alike. He said that the solution lies in achieving prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians. At the same time, he considers himself a believing and pious Jew, and often refers to Jewish ethics. Apparently Gaydamak has an unusual, but also possible reading of Jewish tradition. In an interview to Time magazine he said: "I am a great believer in possibility of peace. Some people misunderstood my reference to Jewish tradition as a nationalist shibboleth, as a desire to exclude and marginalize Arabs. Nothing could be further from truth. I believe in humanism of Jewish tradition. It is impossible for Jews to be happy and content as long as their neighbours suffer. We should not push the Arab population to be under the extremist influence. In my view, it is the Palestinian living standards that should be increased. It does not have to be done at the Israeli taxpayer's expense: the Palestinians are able to cope if we don't block their development."

More uncommon is his compassion for the ordinary Israeli. During the Lebanon War last summer, when the Israeli left and right spoke of beating the hell out of the Northern neighbour, Gaydamak attended to the needy ones: he organized and paid for a summer camp for thousands of Galilee residents who preferred to stay far away from the deadly missile rain. He was accused by media of anti-Zionist behaviour: a good Zionist, they say, should rather die than retreat. But the ordinary people of Galilee were grateful, because they had no intention of dying in order to make a point.

In the confrontation with Hamas, he also took an unusual line. While Israeli politicians demanded the ruin of Gaza, Gaydamak took care of poor residents of Sderot, a small border town bombed by Hamas. He sent coaches and ferried the inhabitants to take a rest in the luxurious resort of Eilat. This made Olmert mad at him: Olmert, and the government, prefers to reap political benefits from the suffering of ordinary Israelis. Gaydamak was accused of doing his good deeds in order to ingratiate himself with the people; but the people were happy that somebody cared for them.

There is a media campaign against him, of rather crude kind. If he is Russian, they say, he's got to be a KGB agent. If he is wealthy he's got to be crook. If he is in Israel, he's got to be in need of refuge. But he is not fragile, this Mr Gaydamak. I had the real pleasure of watching him some time ago on TV: he was invited to appear on a show the same way a bull is invited to a bullfight; but it was the matadors who were carried out from the arena on stretchers. The man on the other side was Matti Golan, ex-chief editor of Ha'aretz. He was complaining about why anybody would attention to Gaydamak at all, as he does not belong to the Salt of the Earth (this is the appellation for real true-blue Israelis).

This media onslaught was rather counterproductive for it made him an underdog and brought him much sympathy. "He is a criminal!" a reporter would ask the public, and will get "We do not think so" in response. Indeed, there are many accusations against Gaydamak, though none led to convictions.

They claim that "Gaydamak is wanted in France for illegal arms dealing." This is lie. While preparing this piece, I went to Paris, to my colleagues-journalists who had followed Gaydamak for a long time. They are experts in digging dirt. And they told me: this is gornicht, he is clean.

The AngolaGate affair as it is called in France ran as follows: in the 1990s, Arcadi Gaydamak helped to arrange a swap of Angola oil for Russian arms; these arms helped the legitimate Angolan government to put down the apartheid South Africa-supported insurgency of Savimbi and his Unita. This deal was perfectly legitimate, as Angola was not under embargo, it was and is a sovereign state and is perfectly allowed to buy arms. Moreover, Savimbi was a horrible creature, always reneging on peace settlements and bloodying Angola. He was a product of Cold War thinking: like Osama Bin Laden, he was promoted and supported by Reagan's administration in their fight against "The Evil Empire". Even if Mr Gaydamak were to supply arms to Angola, it would be a good deed. However, he had no connection to arms trading. He was into oil, Angola had difficulty selling its oil, and so here came Gaydamak to arrange the swap. The arms angle, or AngolaGate as they call it in France, was overblown for purely political, internal French reasons (a confrontation between President Chirac and the interior minister Pasqua.) Anyway, now it is over, only a fiscal claim remains.

The French Treasury thought that the profits from this deal should be shared with the French Republic, for a French-listed company was involved, though neither arms nor oil passed through France. In order to collect, the wily French fiscal judge Philip Courroye locked up everybody connected with the deal. He promised to lock Gaydamak up and throw the keys away unless he delivers. This method was very popular in medieval France and Germany: you catch a Jew and lock him up until he pays. French law allows authorities to keep a person in jail for up to four years without actually charging him. Gaydamak prudently made himself scarce until the time a legitimate court of France will deliver its judgement whether he should pay the tax on the deal.

Moreover, while it is legitimate to refer to the Angola arms story (it made a lot of headlines) I wonder whether an honest reporter may completely overlook the fact that Gaydamak received the highest award of France, the Legion d'Honneur? It just does not happen to fit with denigrating epithets like "shady" and "murky" that usually are attached by the enemies. France does not award this distinction to dubious personalities.

The reason he received the medal also tells much about the man. Endangering himself, he saved two French pilots stranded in Yugoslavia. He had to confront not only Yugoslav militias, but also some elements in the French intelligence and media who wanted to use this incident to fan anti-Yugoslav hysteria and escalate NATO war against that country. Thus Gaydamak is very much a good man: he stopped the Savimbi gangs from despoiling Angola, and he did not allow French warmongers to attack Yugoslavia on false pretext. In vain will you look for this story in the recent internet writing.

Another affair connected to Gaydamak, the Bank Hapoalim case, was also started by the French in their attempt to lay hands of Gaydamak's capital. He reportedly shifted the money outside of the grasping hands of Israeli justice, but this was just prudence. Anyway, after two years of investigations no charges were made.

Meanwhile, he continues to spread his charity. He provided the poor religious Jews with a hospital. His political capital grows. Now he starred in a commercial of a mobile telephone company, being modelled on a socialist Russian Zionist who founded the kibbutz movement a hundred years ago. In the clip, he drops his elegant attire and joins the working masses. With this clip, he rose to the status of Culture Hero. "This is undignified! Netanyahu would never do it!" - insisted media. "I am the man in the street," he retorted.

Gaydamak is probably today the most popular Israeli personality with humane views. He speaks of bringing to power the coalition of the powerless: Sephardis, Russians, Palestinians, workers, religious Jews, the whole hog of hoi polloi. Nobody has yet succeeded in squeezing from him a demand to erase Gaza or bomb Beirut, though it is considered to be de rigueur in the polite society of Israel. He is an opposite to Lieberman, another Russian politician, who made his name by extreme nationalist slogans. He is a black sheep in the company of Russian Jewish oligarchs as he keeps his foothold in Moscow and does not fight Putin, as Nevzlin and Berezovsky do. And he wants to save Israel, as he said in the TV interview. God knows, Israel needs somebody to save her from her own deprivation.

His decision to run for the mayor of Jerusalem gives a chance to truly unite the City. Now, the City Hall carries on endless warfare against the Palestinians of Jerusalem. This is one of the reasons why one third of city's population still consider themselves living under occupation. Gaydamak may be a uniting figure if he can bring together the underprivileged dwellers of Mea Shearim, of Katamonim and of the Old City. Gaydamak is not a revolutionary, he is not even a radical, but this rather conservative man (again, like Ross Perot) has a positive idea of equality and fair play, a flair for business and uncommon organisational ability. Being brought up in the Soviet Union, he has no racist or religious prejudice. Probably this man offers us the best chance for a change and for a good life in One City.

<title>Government to allow limited consular weddings</title>
<date>3/9/2007</date>
<content>
Couples will be allowed to marry in consular weddings in Israel as long as both parties are classified as having no religion or belonging to religions that are not recognized as religious communities in Israel, the state announced Sunday.

It marks the first time the government has made a conscious decision to allow any type of civil marriage ceremony for Israeli citizens to take place on Israeli soil.

"This is a breakthrough," said Michael Corinaldi, the attorney representing two High Court of Justice petitions demanding that the government allow consular marriages. He predicted Sunday's decision would set a precedent for the further expansion of civil marriages.

But Irit Rosenberg, one of the petitioners and head of the New Family organization that champions the rights of unconventional families, told The Jerusalem Post she was infuriated by the decision and had asked Corinaldi to withdraw her petition. "I do not want my name associated with the government's statement," she said.

Corinaldi received a letter earlier in the day announcing the state's new policy from Shai Nitzan, head of the Special Tasks Division in the State Attorney's Office.

In the past, consulates did conduct marriages in Israeli, under an international agreement recognized by Israel that allows couples to be married by a foreign consul if at least one of the partners is a citizen of the country represented by the consul. But in 1995, the Foreign Ministry issued a directive to all the consulates in Israel prohibiting them from conducting such weddings for Israeli citizens.

In 2000, Corinaldi petitioned the High Court against the government prohibition on behalf of New Family. In that petition, Rosenblum demanded that the government allow consuls to conduct marriages regardless of the religion of the two partners.

Two years later, Corinaldi petitioned the court again, this time demanding that the government allow consular marriages for couples classified as having no religion.

During the seven years since the first petition was filed, the state and the High Court kept putting off the case. After one such postponement in March 2006, Corinaldi complained that "the court has set 10 different dates to hear the petitions. Each time, some other cabinet minister was replaced. Once it was the foreign minister, another time the interior minister and a third time the prime minister."

There has not been a single hearing in the 18 months since then.

According to Nitzan's letter to Corinaldi, consuls will not be allowed to marry anyone who changed his religious classification or nationality entry in the Population Registry before the scheduled marriage. They will also not be allowed to marry a couple if one of the partners is a foreign worker present in Israel without a permit. Before conducting the marriage, the consul will have to make certain the couple has been issued a document by the Interior Ministry affirming they meet the state's conditions.

"We waited seven years only to achieve this impossible result," said Rosenblum. "The new government policy will only allow a handful of people to marry in Israel. We have won a Pyrrhic victory that will enable the government to avoid the issue for another 60 years."

Rosenblum added that it was wrong to force foreign consuls to examine the religious status of the couple. "This is an apartheid policy, where religion is the determining factor," she said.

<title>Histadrut to cut ties with UK union</title>
<date>8/7/2007</date>
<content>
The Histadrut Labor Federation is to cut all ties with the Transport and General Workers Union, the 800,000 member British union which last week joined the growing roster of British trade unions demanding boycotts of Israel.

Histadrut Chairman Ofer Eini is also expected to propose on Monday that his organization cut all ties with groups that back boycotts. This follows last month's introduction of a bill by Kadima MK Otniel Schneller requiring the tagging of exports to Israel from countries where anti-Israel boycotts are being promoted with stickers stating: "This country is involved in an anti-Israel boycott."

On Sunday, the British Embassy in Tel Aviv reiterated its opposition to the escalating series of UK union boycott moves. "The British government opposes boycotts of any kind," it said in a statement, going on to say that "the boycott declared by the Transport and General Workers Union will not harm the growing commercial relations between the two countries."

The Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), which merged with Amicus, another union, on May 1 to form "Unite," approved an Israel boycott call at its biennial Delegates Conference in Brighton, England, last week.

The union backed a boycott of Israeli products in protest against "the treatment of the Palestinian people."

"We send a message to the Israeli state by our support for a boycott of Israeli products and goods," said Barry Camfield, assistant general secretary of the union. "This is not a call to boycott dialogue or for industrial action. As with South Africa, a boycott played a key part in liberating that country from apartheid. Now, we work to liberate the Palestinian people from their suffering at the hands of the Israeli state's military machine."

"This vote won't help the Palestinians and it won't help bring about peace," said Lorna Fitzsimons, chief executive of BICOM [British Israel Communication and Research Centre] and co-chair of the Stop the Boycott Campaign. "Let's be clear this is a bad day for TGWU and their members, bringing itself into disrepute."

The Trade Union Friends of Israel was refused a meeting with the TGWU's general secretary prior to and at the conference last week. Throughout the four-day delegates' meeting, TUFI had a stand in the conference center.

Doreen Gerson, executive vice chairwoman of Trade Union Friends of Israel, said: "The vote was extremely rushed, as time had run over and there was not enough time for discussion, and the many delegates who wanted to speak against the motion were denied the opportunity."

Ahead of the vote, Eric McDonald, secretary of TGWU's Birmingham branch, which proposed the boycott motion, compared Israel to Nazi Germany.

American Jewish Committee Executive Director David A. Harris [Read Harris's blog on JPost.com] called McDonald's words a "despicable expression of anti-Semitism." Harris cited the "Working Definition of anti-Semitism," first adopted by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia, and now endorsed by various European bodies, including the UK Parliamentary Inquiry into anti-Semitism.

"Whereas traditional anti-Semitism stigmatized and isolated the individual Jew, these recent boycott votes are attempts to stigmatize and isolate the Jewish state," said Harris.

The union also called for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq and the ruling-out of military engagement with Iran or Syria.

During the Second Lebanon War last August, Camfield spoke at an anti-Israel demonstration in central London. To a crowd waving Hizbullah flags, Camfield said Israel deliberately targeted schools, hospitals, blocks of houses and UN observers, all while "protected by the US, supported by Britain."

He also called for Jews around the world to reject Israel. "I say this to Jewish men and women across the country, in a country that stood against Hitler and the Nazis to liberate Jewish men and women in the Holocaust, that Jewish men and women in this country and across the world must reject the Israeli state and what is happening in the name of Jewish men and women," he said.
Schneller drafted his export sticker legislation soon after Britain's University and College Union decided to consider a boycott of Israeli academic institutions.

"We must respond to this current trend in the UK. If the British think that they can pass judgment on us as a group and boycott us in this manner, than we must respond similarly to the British," Schneller said.

Israeli flower exporters claimed victory on Wednesday following a two-day demonstration by anti-Israel activists attempting to disrupt flower trucks from leaving the UK headquarters of Carmel-Agrexco for Valentine's Day.

The protesters gathered over the weekend, some chaining themselves to the gates of the factory, in an attempt to stop the distribution of the Israeli flowers.

Amos Orr, general manager of Carmel-Agrexco UK, told The Jerusalem Post that the demonstrators had not succeeded in causing any disruptions and all consignments reached their destinations safely.

"Firstly, they came on the quietest day of the week [Saturday]; secondly we knew in advance that they were coming - they had advertised it over two months ago on various Web sites - so we simply arranged for deliveries to be sent out in the morning."

"Trucks that came later were able to make it though as the police simply moved the protesters aside," he added. "On Sunday around 15 activists came. There was no activity, the police came and arrested a few and it was all over within an hour-and-a-half."

Tom Hayes, spokesman for the Boycott Israeli Goods campaign (BIG), defended the protest action, saying it had achieved the publicity it sought.

"The purpose of the protest was to get a large number of people to come to the depot to spread the word and show companies that profit from the occupation," he told the Post. "Our actions were a success. The protest caused disruption during the busiest weekend. Many more people are aware of Carmel-Agrexco and we showed that we're not going to sit by while companies profit from apartheid."

BIG was set up by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, a pro-Palestinian lobby group which calls for a blanket boycott of, divestment from and sanctions against Israel.

"Before taking part in this action, many of the defendants had witnessed first hand the suffering of Palestinian communities under the brutal Israeli occupation," Hayes said. "They do not accept the UK's complicity in the illegal occupation of Palestine and see the presence of this company as a violation of human rights."

Meanwhile, a new Jewish group has emerged to support BIG. Deborah Fink, a member of Jews for Justice for Palestinians (JfJfP), said she had set up Jews for Boycott of Israel Goods (J-BIG).

"I wanted to do more on the boycott and wanted JfJfP to do it but couldn't push them into doing it so in the end I started my own group and agreed last month to join up with BIG," Fink told the Post. "I have about 30 signatories, which I know sounds small, but we have only just started."

Last November, JfJfP disassociated the group from comments Fink made on an anti-Zionist blog in which she said: "Israel does not deserve to be called 'the Jewish state.' It should be called 'the Satanic state.' I really don't see the point of doing anything else other than boycott it in every possible way."

Dan Judelson, chair of JfJfP, said Fink's comments were "incompatible" with the philosophy of the group, and she spoke only for herself.

Last July, JfJfP sparked a furor in the community after it organized an advertisement in The Times signed by more than 300 British Jews condemning Israeli actions in Gaza following the abduction of Gilad Schalit.

<title>Israeli NGO vows Amazon boycott over Carter review</title>
<date>18/1/2007</date>
<content>
LONDON - The Israeli Committee against House Demolitions (ICAHD) has opened a campaign to censor on-line retailer Amazon.com following the posting of a critical review of former US president Jimmy Carter's book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.

The group said the article, written by a customer, was "hostile" to Carter's viewpoint and had been placed in the wrong section of the Web page on the book.

In an e-mail, ICAHD said it was "deeply disturbed" by the treatment of Carter's "important new book" and had issued an ultimatum demanding Amazon move the negative review and "restore a semblance of balance" by giving "comparable space and prominence to a more positive evaluation" of the book.

The group is asking people to write to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO, and to boycott the company. The e-mail says: "You insist on running the complete, 20-paragraph, 1,636-word text of a review unabashedly hostile to Carter's viewpoint.

"You have refused to add information shoppers should have in evaluating this review: the fact that the reviewer, Jeffrey Goldberg, is a citizen of Israel as well as the US, and that he volunteered to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces, for which he worked as a guard at a prison for Palestinian detainees.

"And you have refused to balance his negative review by giving comparable space to a favorable assessment of the book, even though positive reviews by qualified experts have appeared in many reputable publications."

The ICAHD said it was "not interested in supporting a corporation that uses its power in the marketplace in such a biased and unconstructive way on such an important issue."

An ultimatum is then delivered: "If you do not, by January 22, remove the Goldberg review, move it to the more appropriate 'See all Editorial Reviews' page, or restore a semblance of balance by giving comparable space and prominence to a more positive evaluation of Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, we... pledge to stop shopping at Amazon... and encourage our friends, family and associates to do likewise."

In a March 2005 brief, NGO Monitor, part of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, described the Committee against House Demolitions as "a well-funded, blatantly political and ideological one-man NGO, which couches its radical anti-Israel agenda and demonization in the rhetoric of human rights."

The brief continues: ICAHD coordinator Jeff "Halper routinely uses terms such as 'apartheid' and 'war crimes' to refer to Israeli policy against Palestinian terror, supports a 'one state solution,' and advocates sanctions and boycotts."

<title>'Israel resembles an apartheid state'</title>
<date>22/2/2007</date>
<content>
An independent report commissioned by the United Nations compares Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza to apartheid South Africa - charges that drew angry rebukes from Israel and were sure to revive charges that the UN Human Rights Council is biased against the Jewish state.

The report by John Dugard, independent investigator on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the council, is to be presented next month, but it has been posted on the body's Web site. In it, Dugard, a South African lawyer who campaigned against apartheid in the 1980s, says "Israel's laws and practices in the (Palestinian territories) certainly resemble aspects of apartheid."

 S. African Jewish minister supports 'Israeli Apartheid Week'

The 24-page report catalogues a number of accusations against the Jewish state ranging from restrictions on Palestinian movement, house demolitions and preferential treatment given to Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

"Can it seriously be denied that the purpose of such action is to establish and maintain domination by one racial group - Jews - over another racial group - Palestinians - and systematically oppress them?" he asks.

Israel says it aims mainly to prevent Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks that have killed more than 1,000 Israelis in the past six years, and officials note that violence broke out in 2000 after Israel's proposal to pull out of the vast majority of the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for peace was rejected.

Its ambassador in Geneva criticized Dugard for directing attacks only at the Jewish state. "Any conclusions he may draw are therefore fundamentally flawed and purposely biased," said Yitzhak Levanon.

The report will be presented next month at the 47-nation rights council's first session of the year. The new body has been widely criticized - even by its founder, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan - for only censuring one government in the world, Israel's, over alleged abuses.

Dugard's report accuses Israel of "terror" by F16 fighter jets setting off sonic booms above residential areas. In the West Bank "residents live in fear of settler terror."

He says it is "grossly inaccurate" to say Israel's 2005 removal of settlers and soldiers from Gaza constituted an end to its occupation of that territory, captured from Egypt in the 1967 war. "Israel retained control of Gaza's air space, sea space and external borders, and the border crossings," he writes. "Gaza became a sealed off, imprisoned and occupied territory."

War crimes have been committed by both sides, he says: "This applies to Palestinians who fire Kassam rockets into Israel; and more so to members of the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) who have committed such crimes on a much greater scale."

Dugard was appointed in 2001 as an unpaid expert by the now-defunct UN Human Rights Commission to investigate only violations by the Israeli side, prompting Israel and the United States to dismiss his reports as one-sided. Israel refused to allow him to conduct a fact-finding mission on its Gaza offensive last summer.

<title>'Israel slander corrupts human rights'</title>
<date>13/2/2007</date>
<content>
Human rights are misused by anti-Semitic anti-Israel campaigns that mask their efforts to dismember the only Jewish state through sophisticated and insidious use of the language of human rights, former Canadian justice minister Irwin Cotler, an internationally renowned expert on human rights, told the closing session of the Global Forum for Combating Anti-Semitism in Jerusalem on Monday.

"When anti-Semitism marches under the banner of anti-racism, as in the Durban conference, human rights are corrupted," he told The Jerusalem Post on Monday evening after his speech to the Forum.

"Israel is delegitimized, if not demonized, by the ascription to it of the two most scurrilous indictments of twentieth-century racism, Nazism and apartheid the embodiment of all evil," according to Cotler. This has the disingenuous effect of turning an antisemitic indictment calling for Israel's dismantlement into a moral imperative; and to seek to give it the imprimatur of the United Nations and international law.

It uses the "struggle against racism as a pretext to dismantle Israel, [since] you dismantle an apartheid state. As a person who struggled against apartheid, this is a pernicious use of [that idea]," he said.

Cotler also discussed the use of the United Nations to further the anti-Israel agenda. "Those of us who care about human rights must ensure that the integrity of the UN is preserved, and that the authenticity of the struggle for human rights is preserved," he said.

In his speech, he explained that this anti-Semitism seeks, at one and the same time, to mask itself under the banner of human rights, to invoke the authority of international law and to operate under the protective cover of the United Nations, the lynchpin of international human rights law. In a word and in an Orwellian inversion of human rights, language and law the singling out of Israel and the Jewish people for differential and discriminatory treatment in the international arena is legalized.

Prof. Richard Landes of Boston University spoke of the ways in which anti-Semitism is easily spread by mainstream Western media. "Muslim political culture uses the media as a theater of war," he told the Post on Monday evening, echoing his speech to the 160 delegates from Israel and the Diaspora who participated in the Forum. "The western media is inexcusably credulous and therefore allows this sacred public trust to be exploited."

Landes urged Israel to "stand up [for itself]. In the same way the media behaves in a submissive way [in the face of] Muslim political culture, the Israelis behave in a submissive way toward the mainstream media. They don't want to confront them.

"So you have a death-lock in which the Muslims present vicious propaganda and get the media to present this as real news. As it is, Western Europe is not resisting the onslaught of Islamism. Part of the reason is that they don't know how to defend themselves. Israel could provide an example for this [defense]."

Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, speaking on Sunday at the opening session of the Forum, also related to the international possibilities for combating anti-Semitism. "You might be surprised how easy it is to recruit international support [for combating anti-Semitism], if we just show determination," she declared.

While affirming that "the battle is to be fought, first and foremost, by the State of Israel as the Jewish homeland" and "by the entire Jewish nation," Livni insisted that "this should also be the battle fought by the free world."

As an example, Livni cited a declaration issued Sunday by Spanish King Juan Carlos I, which affirmed the "moral mission of the international community" to "remember the Holocaust" and "to work for the victory of truth and justice." The declaration came, she said, at her request, and was an example that the international community was willing to act against anti-Semitism if asked to do so.

The Global Forum is a two-day event run by the Foreign Ministry that brings together 160 Jewish leaders and academics to develop policy recommendations for dealing with the worldwide phenomenon of anti-Semitism. Many speakers at the opening session and throughout the first day of the Forum on Sunday noted with frank concern the growing threat of anti-Semitic sentiments throughout the world.

"Anti-Semitism is stronger today than it was 10 years ago," said Pierre Besnainou, president of the European Jewish Congress, an umbrella group representing organized Jewry in 38 countries. "The threat is real and our duty is to face and deal with this concern," he added.

Malcolm Hoenlein, Executive Vice President of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, warned that "the greatest weakness of the Jewish people is indifference and apathy" in the face of these threats.

Quoting the Passover Haggadah's warning that "in every generation, they rise up against us to destroy us," Hoenlein said that globalization changed the severity of the threat. "Today, the Big Lie [of Jewish world-domination] can spread to billions in seconds," he explained. "We need to learn this power."

Among the initiatives he suggested that Forum participants consider is a "worldwide registry of anti-Semitic incidents" that would "monitor the arrest, prosecution and conviction of those who perpetrate these acts."

Rabbi Israel Singer, chairman of the World Jewish Congress Policy Council, called on Jewish leaders to broaden their understanding of who can be a partner in the war against anti-Semitism.

"We think whoever isn't with us on every issue is against us," he complained, noting that the alliances during the Soviet Jewry campaigns of the 1970's, such as the alliance with American labor unions and others, were gone. There was no reason, he added, that left-wing musicians and others "who are not our allies" could not be brought into the battle against anti-Semitism.

<title>Israel wants US and EU to snub Durban II</title>
<date>30/12/2007</date>
<content>
Israeli diplomats are quietly working to convince the United States and the European Union to boycott - and defund - a possible follow-up to the 2001 World Conference Against Racism conference in Durban, South Africa.

The efforts call on the US, which funds over one-fifth of the UN budget, to pull 21 percent of its share of the $6.8 million budget for the Durban Review Conference (or some $1.4m.) out of its annual payment to the UN.

The conference is being planned by a UN bureau chaired by Libya that counts Iran and Pakistan among its members.

Israeli officials hope to convince the Europeans and "like-minded" countries, such as Australia and Canada, to do the same and thereby cause a funding shortfall for the conference, which looks set to repeat the displays of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism that dominated much of the original conference.

The Israeli move comes after the December 22 passage of the $4.2 billion UN budget for 2008-2009, which includes the funding for "Durban II," as diplomats are styling the follow-up conference. The general budget passed 142 to one, with only the US voting against.

The 2001 conference, which ended just three days before the September 11 attacks in the US, saw the US and Israel withdraw their delegations halfway through the gathering due in part to language equating Zionism with racism. The language was advanced by Syria and Iran, but was rejected in the final Durban Declaration and Program of Action after African and Western states intervened in the deliberations to moderate the original language.

However, an international NGO forum meeting alongside the conference of governments issued a declaration of its own, which approved language equating Zionism with racism and apartheid. It was, according to some experts, the launch of the ongoing campaign that seeks to draw a comparison between Israel and apartheid South Africa.

Though it still has no venue or date, Durban II is slated to take place sometime in 2009. The UN's Human Rights Council has taken the lead in implementing it, appointing a 20-nation bureau chaired by Libya, vice-chaired by Cuba and including Iran, Pakistan and Indonesia, to carry out the bulk of the planning.

Already, Israeli officials are expressing suspicion over the schedule of preparatory meetings that will lead up to the 2009 conference, the first of which comes over the Pessah holiday in April 2008, and the second in October, on the week coinciding with Yom Kippur.

"Maybe it was just a scheduling mistake, but maybe it was to keep Jewish NGOs from monitoring the preparations for Durban II," said an Israeli official.

While the larger budget passed almost unanimously, many European and Western states have expressed opposition to the Durban II budget.

"There are hopeful signs," said an Israeli Foreign Ministry official Sunday. "The entire Western bloc, the EU, Australia, New Zealand, the US, even Japan, all seem to oppose Durban. Most of the support for it comes from the nonaligned countries and the Arab-Muslim bloc."

While the West still faces a three-to-one opposition even in this optimistic scenario, "the situation is better now than it was [in 2001]," the official believes.

In response, the Foreign Ministry has decided to mobilize its resources and coordinate with friends overseas. Gil Haskel, head of the NGO unit in the Foreign Ministry's Division for UN and International Organizations, is in charge of a new diplomatic program that will coordinate between Israel, Jewish organizations around the world and non-Jewish NGOs to prepare a coordinated and focused response to a possible reenactment of the first conference.

The 2001 conference, he says, "was a trauma not only for Israel, but for a lot of sane societies," and "the current [HRC] bureau's composition alone is an indication of the dangerous direction in which Israel feels Durban II is going."

The Foreign Ministry has been criticized for failing to realize ahead of time or to respond quickly to the ferocity of anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist campaigning that was to take place at Durban I, while Israeli delegates were uncoordinated with many Jewish activists who arrived on the scene to help in the hasbara efforts.

Following a planning meeting last week, the Foreign Ministry will host Jewish organizational and communal leaders from around the world in Jerusalem in late February to begin coordinating a shared strategy and to establish an international task force that will maintain "a shared message, so that what comes out of Jerusalem and what comes out of Washington, New York or London don't contradict each other," Haskel said.

<title>Jewish groups unify under Hillel banner</title>
<date>1/1/2007</date>
<content>
In a rare, if not unprecedented, instance of Jewish bureaucracy slashing, the alphabet soup of organizations promoting Jewish activities among 18-25-year-olds in the Former Soviet Union are marking the new year by beginning to consolidate under the single banner of Hillel.

Where hitherto Hillel, the Jewish Agency, the Joint Distribution Committee, the Schusterman Family Foundation, the Chais Family Foundation and others had run their own separate projects for this age group in the FSU - everything from summer camps, to birthright trips, to campus activism - they are now harmonizing, Hillel's new president, Wayne Firestone, told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.

The transition process, involving a unifying of everything from office premises to bank accounts, is slated to take 18 months. It has been prompted both by a recognition that a single hierarchy should be more efficient and by simple economic necessity.

"Fundraising [for the various activities] has been flat for several years," said Firestone. "But costs are rising in the FSU. There was no choice but to get together and to work together to raise more money."

Indeed, he added, the harmonizing organizations have secured a $2.5 million budget for the coming year, compared to $1.5 million for last year.

Firestone said Hillel was active in 40 cities across the FSU. The joint programs, he said, would impact "thousands, and potentially tens of thousands, of students."

He said a decade of Hillel's focus on the FSU had yielded a vibrant young Jewish leadership there, "people who are not necessarily thinking of aliya, but emphatically see themselves as part of the Jewish people."

Firestone, who took over the Hillel presidency recently from the veteran Jewish educator Avraham Infeld, highlighted the growing vibrancy of Hillel in Israel, too. Hillel centers have gradually opened up at almost all of Israel's universities, developing programs to bolster the sense of Jewish peoplehood.

In North America, meanwhile, Hillel is active on 115 campuses - those places of education attended by 85 percent of young American Jews.

Firestone said that "in-your-face anti-Israel activism" had faded dramatically on US campuses since the recent peak years of hostility at the height of the second intifada.

"Those protesters have essentially failed," he said. "I mean, how do you sell Hamas and Iran to mainstream Americans?"

However, he cautioned against a sanguine sense of quiet. The new trend was that of purportedly solid academic opposition to Israel, as exemplified by the Stephen Walt-John Mearsheimer assertions of an Israel lobby dramatically influencing American government thinking. "And now we have an ex-president [Jimmy Carter] writing a book about apartheid [in the Israel context]."

Firestone said he was still seeking answers for how to deal with this trend, but that "the one thing not to do is to shout [to Carter and to Israel-critical academics], 'Hey, you can't say that!' That approach is guaranteed to fail in academia. You have to address the content."

Hillel, which also calls itself the "Foundation for Jewish Campus Life," aims to encourage students "to explore and celebrate their Jewish identity... so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world."

It strives to help students "find a balance in being distinctively Jewish and universally human by encouraging them to pursue social justice, tikkun olam (repairing the world) and Jewish learning, and to support Israel and global Jewish peoplehood."

<title>Jewish Hebron market heir opposes settlers</title>
<date>26/8/2007</date>
<content>
The descendent of the Jewish owner of Hebron's disputed marketplace is left wing, secular and lives in Tel Aviv.

Unlike the Hebron Jews who were forcibly evicted from the marketplace on August 7, retired journalist Haim Hanegbi, 72, does not dream of returning to the city where his family lived for more than 200 years.

There, settlers have placed a large white banner over the empty shops in which they demand: "Return the stolen property."

They believe that because this marketplace was once owned by Hanegbi's grandfather, Haim Bejayo, and used by the city's Jewish community, they have a right to settle the area situated at the entryway to their Avraham Avinu neighborhood.

It's a claim Hanegbi rejects.

"I have more rights than the settlers and the army," he told The Jerusalem Post last week.

He wants the marketplace to revert to the Palestinians who made use of it from the 1930s to 1994, when Israel forced them to shut down the shops after Baruch Goldstein, from nearby Kiryat Arba, killed 29 Palestinians as they prayed in a mosque attached to Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs.

For Hanegbi, the issue is greater than the shops that have made headlines over the last month. He is among a group of 27 descendants of the original Jewish community who believe the government should evacuate all 800 Jewish settlers from Hebron.

"We have to throw them out of Hebron down to the last one," said Hanegbi.

He has little sympathy with the settlers' claim to the marketplace. Still, as he explained, the complex web of property ownership in Hebron appears to mean that his family's history has little relevance to the decision about who can use the marketplace.

In 1997, the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria sent Hanegbi a ruling saying the state had a right to the property registered in his grandfather's name. That document, along with a copy of the original deed from 1807 made out to his ancestor Haim Hamitzri, are filed away in a blue plastic folder that Hanegbi took out as he spoke with the Post.

For him, the papers are a piece of the history of his family, which wandered from Spain to North Africa to Egypt and finally to Hebron, where his grandfather was the city's Sephardic rabbi. They fled Hebron in 1929, along with the other survivors of that ancient Jewish community, when local Arabs attacked the Jewish community, killing 67 Jews and wounding 70.

He holds on to these documents to counter the claims by the Jews who settled in Hebron in 1979 that the marketplace area, as well as all Jewish property in the city, is theirs because they are the spiritual inheritors of that pre-1929 community.

"Why do they have a right to this?" he asked.

Two weeks ago, the settlers received a boost from the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee's subcommittee on civilian affairs in Judea and Samaria, which called on both Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Ehud Barak to authorize Jewish settlement in the market.

The Jews moved into the empty shops illegally in 2001, and left of their own volition in 2006 after an agreement with the IDF in which they were reassured that steps would be taken to legalize their presence there.

When Attorney-General Menahem Mazuz annulled the agreement, two families moved back in - only to be forcibly removed.

Government spokesman David Baker said the official position on this matter was unchanged. "What is evident is that Israel is a nation of laws and the laws will be upheld," said Baker.

In Hebron, where settlers believe the government ignored legal arguments that backed their claims, the banner over the marketplace shops charges that it is the government that has stolen the property. "These buildings were constructed on the ruins of the ancient Jewish Quarter following the Arab massacre of Jews in Hebron. The Israeli government continues this banditry," it reads.

Sitting in a cafe near his Ramat Aviv home, Hanegbi accused the settlers, with the help of the IDF, of trying to steal not just the marketplace but all of Hebron from the Palestinians.

He is so angry at the way the 35,000 Palestinians who live in the Israeli section of the city are treated that he has a hard time staying calm as he speaks about their situation.

There are roads that Palestinians cannot drive on, and in some cases cannot walk. There are Palestinian stores that were forced to close and others that went under for lack of business, said Hanegbi. These conditions forced Palestinians to leave the city, he said.

According to the IDF, these conditions are necessary for security reasons.

B'tselem said in May that 659 Hebron apartments had become vacant in the last seven years and some 1,141 businesses had closed.

"I do not know how to sit quietly when people are driven out of their homes," said Hanegbi, who had no problem using the word "apartheid" to describe the situation.

He blames it on the settlers who live there and in whose security interests the government has clamped down on the Palestinians living in the area under its control.

He said he had accepted the prior situation in which the state had leased the property to the Palestinian-run Hebron Municipality. But if the property was not in the hands of the state and was to be turned over to Jews, then it should be returned to his family, he said. To that end, he hired a lawyer in 2006 and turned to the courts.

Hanegbi said he wanted to live by the creed of justice, not nationalism. "Write that I am an anti-Zionist," said Hanegbi, who believes in a "state of all its citizens."

His grandfather, he said, wanted to return to Hebron, "just as every refugee dreams of it. The whole land is filled with people dreaming of returning, that is the nature of the person who wants to return to his roots."

But Hanegbi said he was of the belief that Jews could only come back to Hebron in a situation of justice, in which both Palestinians and Jews had equal rights in the city under the law.

"Justice can't be one-sided," he said. "So I can return only when everyone can return."

<title>J'lem homeless protest missing NIS 1.6b. in housing funds</title>
<date>26/7/2007</date>
<content>
How many apartments could have been bought with a state fund of NIS 1.6 billion that had been earmarked for public housing, but which Knesset sources said has been redirected elsewhere?

"Even our engineers couldn't tell you," said Arik Eldar, deputy director-general of Amigur, the Jewish Agency's housing subsidiary. "It's been 30 years since Amigur built new public housing."

More than 100 homeless people encamped in downtown Jerusalem's Gan Menorah will tell you their situation is the fruit of that decision.

"We demand that all this money go immediately to building houses for the people who need homes," said Yossi Levi, 35, who lives in the encampment with his wife and three children. "The government's policies have raised a generation of poor people. We just want to live in dignity."

The encampment's 133 residents, all Sephardim, have spent the past seven weeks living in the ad hoc shelter-cum-demonstration, in the park opposite the Hamashbir department store, where King George Street and Rehov Ben-Yehuda meet. Above the cluster of 22 tents, a banner reads: "Tent of the Victims of Economic and Social Terror."

Construction and Housing Ministry officials highlight rent subsidies as the context for the shift away from building and purchasing new public apartments.

The latter is just one kind of "housing solution," and compared with rent subsidies, it is "perhaps the most expensive and the least suitable," said Chaim Fialkoff, the ministry's acting director-general.

In some cases, however, these subsidies are insufficient, "of course," one ministry representative said.

The homeless demonstrators, many of whom attempt to support families on a combination of wages and such subsidies, have protested this policy as well.

Under the Public Housing Law of 1998, residents of such housing can purchase their apartments at a discount. Money from these sales is then set aside so that more public housing can be purchased or built, said MK Ran Cohen (Meretz), a cosponsor of the law.

From 2000-2007, the Construction and Housing Ministry accrued NIS 1.6b. in such funds, a  ministry representative said.

Ultimately, "not one shekel was used for [buying] a new [public] apartment," Cohen said.

From the NIS 1.6b. fund, the ministry paid NIS 800 million to the Jewish Agency, per an  agreement between the two parties, the ministry representative added.

This agreement was made in 1999, Fialkoff said.

During this time, the policy Cohen had originally envisioned was beginning to change.

"Bibi [then-prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu] succeeded in interfering with the implementation of my law," Cohen said.

As part of that government's efforts at privatization, the state asked Amigur to sell off as many as possible of the public apartments it managed, with any unsold apartments  moving to government management, Jewish Agency spokesman Michael Jankelowitz said.

Many of these apartments had been purchased early in Israel's history with Diaspora Jews' donations that the Jewish Agency had collected, Jankelowitz said.

Ultimately, the government and the Jewish Agency struck a deal whereby the Agency and  Amigur would sell as many of their apartments as they could, and the government would pay  the Jewish Agency for unsold apartments, Jankelowitz said.

These payments amounted to $40,000 per apartment, Fialkoff said.

Such apartments would then be owned by the state, Jankelowitz said, and their occupants would continue to pay rent.

Not everyone supported this agreement.

"It's as though the public is paying for these apartments twice," said one protest supporter at the Gan Menorah camp.

Still, the Construction and Housing Ministry's NIS 800m. payment to the Jewish Agency was  per this agreement, a spokeswoman said.

Afterward, the ministry was required to pay 60 percent of remaining monies to the Finance Ministry, the spokeswoman added.

The other 40% stayed with the ministry, she said.

The end result: The Construction and Housing Ministry retained NIS 320m. - one-fifth of  the original NIS 1.6 billion fund.

This NIS 320m. was also not used to build new apartments, the ministry representative  said. It went instead toward renovations, social programming in underprivileged neighborhoods and incentive packages for those buying homes in the Negev and the Galilee.

"We do not buy any new apartments," the Construction and Housing Ministry representative said.

The exception is that the ministry creates 30 to 50 new housing units per year for those with disabilities, Fialkoff said.

Amigur has also left public housing behind.

"In public housing, we don't build even one unit," Eldar said. The firm has not created new public housing in "many, many years," he added.

What Amigur does build - though Eldar distinguished this activity from general public housing per se - is subsidized homes for the elderly. For instance, he said, in April, Amigur completed one such facility in Jerusalem's Talpiot neighborhood, with 160 new housing units. Ninety-five percent of these units are now occupied. A resident's rent amounts to 8% of his salary, Eldar said.

Such buildings have been funded using a large portion of the NIS 800m. that the  Construction and Housing Ministry redirected to the Jewish Agency, Jankelowitz said. He added that the remainder of these funds went back into the Jewish Agency budget for  activities like aliya and Jewish education in the Diaspora.

Ninety percent of these homes designated for the elderly are occupied by immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Eldar said.

Leaders of the homeless community in Gan Menorah blasted the policy of building housing units for these Ashkenazi immigrants while halting all creation of new public housing units for other Israelis in need.

"It's like apartheid in South Africa," said Ayala Sabag, an activist who leads the Gan  Menorah community, though she is not homeless herself. "We [Sephardim] are the blacks, and the Ashkenazim are the whites."

A family with three children and an income under NIS 4,800 a month could apply for a  long-term rent subsidy of up to NIS 1,800 a month, usually receiving about NIS 1,250 a  month, Fialkoff said.

But the demonstrators in Gan Menorah have decried this practice as well, saying it has discriminated against families with fewer than three children.

For such families, "the policy is: 'Have another child,'" Levi quipped. He said subsidies to smaller families were often closer to NIS 400 or 500 a month, which he said was often insufficient, depending on their income, to pay rent and support a family.

A Construction and Housing Ministry spokeswoman confirmed that subsidies were often this small or even smaller.

Asked whether such supplements were enough to pay rent and support a family, she said,  "Of course not." However, she said that many also received other government subsidies such as National Insurance allotments.

Cohen supports the Gan Menorah group's call to widen eligibility criteria and aid availability for public housing solutions.

"A house to cover the heads of families" is "one of the main services where the country is responsible for our citizens," Cohen said, contrasting this ideal with the "very ugly"  present state of public housing.

Sophie Biton, 33, who has been living at Gan Menorah with her three children, told a personal story that she said exemplified the current policy's problems. Prior to living in Gan Menorah, Biton bounced between park benches and shelters.

"I feared for my children's safety," she said. When she sent her children to live with her sister, Biton faced many more difficulties, ironically, in securing a sufficient rent subsidy, she said.

Around 53,000 Israelis remain stuck in Biton's limbo, Sabag said.

The Central Bureau of Statistics could not confirm this information, saying the bureau did not maintain statistics on homelessness.

"It's a problem," said Alisa Peleg, a CBS official. She confirmed it was unknown how many  "sleep in the streets" and how many were "being taken care of... [with] shelter and a  meal."

Since The Jerusalem Post first reported on the Gan Menorah encampment three weeks ago, the camp's population has risen from 92 to 133, Sabag said.

"All the time, people are coming. People hear about this camp and come because they want solutions," she said.

Initially, the municipality clashed with the Gan Menorah community over the latter's choice of a prominent downtown park. The municipality instead offered Sabag's group the Wohl Rose Garden opposite the Knesset, which Sabag's group declined, a municipality spokesman said.

Eviction was a possibility, he added, though no orders had been issued.

Then, Sabag cited Gan Menorah's visibility as the very thing necessary for the demonstration.

"The municipality doesn't want us here because it doesn't look nice," Sabag told the Post.

Cohen ultimately appreciated the statement Sabag aimed to make. "It's a sad picture to  see them there in the center of the city," he said.

After speaking with Sabag and other members of her community in a recent meeting, Cohen telephoned Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupolianski, asking "not just to leave them there, but to give them all the services they need," Cohen said.

"They are the children of Jerusalem," he added.

The Gan Menorah group plans to remain encamped until August 15, when people in the Ministry of Construction and Housing go on vacation, Levi said. By that date, he hopes the ministry will have heeded calls to redirect funds toward new public housing and to widen the criteria for who is eligible for aid.

"I hope we will receive good news, because we will not give up," Levi said.

<title>MK to attend 'Israel Apartheid week'</title>
<date>13/2/2007</date>
<content>
MK Otniel Shneller (Kadima) on Tuesday demanded that Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz open an investigation against MK Jamal Zahalka (Balad) on suspicion of incitement.

Zahalka is currently on his way to Canada to participate in "Israel Apartheid week", and was quoted as saying that Israel's actions in the occupied territories are similar to those of South Africa under the apartheid regime, Army Radio reported Tuesday.

Former Canadian justice minister Irwin Cotler, who is currently visiting Israel, claims that Zahalka has gone one step too far against the country he is supposed to represent.

Jewish students in Montreal are expected to protest against Zahalka and the events in the program.

<title>Netanyahu: Arabs don't respect a weak PM</title>
<date>29/11/2007</date>
<content>
"Arabs do not respect a weak prime minister," opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu said Thursday following the Annapolis summit, which he described as "a failure."

He said there was "a virtual element" to the conference. "It was as if we were talking peace with a courageous partner but (Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud) Abbas has difficulty ruling his own mukata," Netanyahu told Army Radio.

Netanyahu went on to say that the PA president had not stepped down from any of his demands, adding that "he even wants to join Gaza and the West Bank through the Negev."

The opposition leader said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had made concessions "before Annapolis, during Annapolis and after Annapolis," referring to the supply of armored vehicles to PA forces, to Olmert's refusal to demand that Palestinians stop terror and incitement before negotiations begin, and to the prime minister's comments earlier Thursday that Israel would be "finished" if a two-state solution was not reached.

Olmert made the latter comment in an interview with  Haaretz, saying that the alternative to the creation of a Palestinian state is a South African-style apartheid struggle.

"The day will come when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights," the prime minister had said. "As soon as that happens, the state of Israel is finished."

Referring to the interview, Netanyahu said: "Israel is not finished. It continues and will continue to exist. Reconciliation will not come from a position of weakness; a position of: 'I will accept all your demands or I will disappear into the sea.'"

He said this was not the way to achieve peace, adding that "Arabs don't respect a weak prime minister."

"Tell me one thing we gained at Annapolis?" Netanyahu continued. "We allowed the Palestinians to avoid fighting terror, a condition set in the Road Map. Abbas now doesn't need to do anything. This is the opposite of what is required for peace and security."

Regarding contacts with Syria, Netanyahu said it was acceptable to talk but it "depends on what is being said," asserting that Israel must demand that Syria halt weapons smuggling to Hizbullah and stop allowing Khaled Mashaal and other Hamas leaders to reside in the country. "It is not embarrassing to demand things from Arabs," he added.

Concerning coalition members Shas and Israel Beiteinu, Netanyahu said: "They said they would leave the government when core issues are raised, so this is what the public expects. They tell me that nothing has happened yet, but I disagree."

The opposition leader warned that due to now-inflated Palestinian optimism created at Annapolis there was a risk of a third intifada breaking out when the Palestinians don't receive what they were now expecting.

<title>New Israel-PA radio station to start in English</title>
<date>20/2/2007</date>
<content>
A new English-language Israeli-Palestinian radio station will begin broadcasting in Israel and the PA territories, Israel Radio reported on Tuesday.

The new station, Ram FM, will air daily in studios in Jerusalem and Ramallah, offering music and news broadcasts.

The initiator of the project, South African businessman Izzy Kirsch, said at a press conference that he had decided to start Ram FM following the success of a similar station he set up in South Africa after the fall of the apartheid regime. Kirsch said the South African station was successful because it bridged the gaps between blacks and whites.

When asked how the new radio station would refer to Palestinians who carry out terror attacks, the news manger, Andre Bolton, said it would not use the terms "terrorist" or "freedom fighter", but would remain as true to the facts as possible.

<title>'No legal obstacles to Gaza fuel cuts'</title>
<date>2/11/2007</date>
<content>
If the economic sanctions that Israel has applied against the Gaza Strip in reducing fuel supplies are to be regarded as collective punishment, so should the economic sanctions that were imposed against South Africa during the apartheid years, or those against Iran today.

This was one of the points raised in the state's reply released Friday to a petition calling on the High Court of Justice to nullify the cabinet's decision to declare the Gaza Strip "hostile territory" and apply sanctions that include cutting electricity and fuel supplies and further restricting entry to and exit from the area.

The court is due to hear on Wednesday the petitioners' request for a show-cause order to cancel the original decision. The petitioners are also seeking an interim injunction to prevent the government from cutting electricity and fuel supplies until the court hears and rules on the wider petition.

The petition was filed by Gisha - the Legal Center for Freedom of Movement on behalf of Ahmed Albesioni.

The state told the court that the petition regarding power cuts was premature, since the government had not yet taken any such steps. The Defense Ministry okayed the move, but Attorney-General Menahem Mazuz has overruled the decision for the time being because the consequences of such a move on the humanitarian situation in Gaza has not yet been fully calculated.

However, Mazuz did approve the decision to reduce supplies of gasoline and diesel, and it went into effect last week. The state informed the court that the amount of gasoline allowed into Gaza had been cut from an average of 350,000-400,000 liters per week to 300,000 liters. The government is also considering a further, gradual reduction.

Diesel exports were cut from 1.4 million liters per week to 1.2 million liters. The state added that "according to government estimates, "the amount of fuel necessary to fulfill the Gaza Strip's humanitarian needs does not amount to more than 50 percent of the amount supplied today, and this is a conservative estimate which provides a significant safety margin."

The state added that the export of diesel for use in Gaza's power station had been reduced from an average of 2.2 million liters to 1.75 million per week. It said that in September, the Palestinians in Gaza had added a third turbine to provide additional power. When only two turbines operate, the power station produces 55 megawatts of electricity. When the third one functions, supply goes up to 63 megawatts. The drop in diesel exports imposed by Israel last week means that the amount of electricity provided for Gaza will return to the pre-September level.

<title>Rare praise for Israel in UN probe</title>
<date>23/2/2007</date>
<content>
In a surprising move, the United Nations anti-racism panel on Thursday praised Israel for the detailed report it had provided  on issues relating to racism and discrimination, according to Israel's Ambassador to the UN in Geneva Yitzhak Levanon.

As a result, Levanon told The Jerusalem Post from Geneva, "I'm optimistic" that Israel would receive a fair hearing as the UN conducts its periodic review of the state's compliance with its convention against racial discrimination.

Levanon's appearance in front of the panel on Thursday marks the first time in nine years that Israel has had a formal hearing before the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).

'Israel resembles an apartheid state'

The two-day hearing in which Israel will defend its record on racism and discrimination is part of CERD's 70th session scheduled to run from February 19 to March 9. During that time it will review the records of 13 of the 173 countries which have ratified its treaty. Israel signed onto it in 1979.

In the past Levanon has charged the UN with anti-Israel bias and, in particular, has leveled harsh criticism against its Human Rights Council.

CERD, he said, was different in that it was less politicized than other committees and was composed of 18 international professionals in the field of human rights. Still, he said, there was a contentious atmosphere in the 1998 hearing, which was absent during Thursday's meeting.

Levanon told the Post that in spite of the friendly start, he expected the committee to be critical of Israel both during the continuation of the hearing on Friday and in the final written report, which the committee is likely to issue in the near future. But at least, Levanon said, he was hopeful that it would be balanced in its critique.

As evidence of the hard road ahead of him on Friday, the committee on Thursday added 13 additional questions to the list of 28 that it had given the state in August, most of which relate to Israel's treatment of Palestinians and Israeli-Arab citizens.

Absent so far from the UN's probe is Israel's controversial decision to build an access bridge to the Temple Mount by the Mughrabi gate.

In light of the furor created by the move within the Muslim world, the Algerian expert asked why Israel had to make this move now, Levanon said.

But the committee didn't formally include the matter in its list of questions on issues of discrimination and racism, Levanon said.

The UN has queried the state on matters relating to the security fence, care of Muslim holy sites, citizenship and treatment of Palestinians. It asked Israel to explain the disparity that exists between its Jewish and Arab citizens on a host of issues, including, military service, land acquisition, criminal conviction rates, funding, education, health and legal protection.

In addition, the UN panel said it wanted to look at Israel's decision not to grant residency rights to Palestinians married to Israelis, and the failure to indict those responsible for the deaths of 13 Israeli Arabs in the October 2000 riots.

In speaking to the committee on Thursday, Levanon said that Israel's record on discrimination should be viewed in light of its battle against terrorism.

"This reality imposes major burdens to [the] ideal implementation of the Convention, especially with regard to its scope, as so many resources and energy are understandably diverted to upholding Israel's security," Levanon said.

"I urge you to look through the prism of these special and unique circumstances when reviewing our report and our answers to your questions," he added.

He spoke of the violence between Israelis and Palestinians, which has been ongoing since October 2000, the war with Hizbullah this summer, the kidnapping of three of its soldiers, as well as the election of a "terrorist" group to head the Palestinian authority. In addition, he made note of the fact that Israel had withdrawn from Gaza in the summer of 2005.

In spite of all these major events, he said, Israel had still taken a number of positive steps to comply with the anti-discrimination treaty since it last appeared before the committee.

For the first time in the state's history an Israeli Arab, MK Ghaleb Majadle (Labor), was appointed to the cabinet, Levanon said.

New legislation existed to help protect minority citizens, Levanon said. He pointed to the Public Places Law which prohibits discrimination in schools, libraries, pools, stores, entertainment and other public areas.

In addition, Levanon said, the state passed a Pupil's Rights Law which made discrimination illegal when it comes to admissions to educational institutes.

Migrant workers have also received increased protection through the Foreign Worker's Law, he said.

Levanon told the committee that Israel was a democratic country dedicated to the elimination of racial discrimination and that this value was set out in its Declaration of Independence.

Nine officials who flew to Geneva from Israel to help defend Israel's record joined him before the committee. Included among them were professionals from the State Attorney's Office and the ministries of Justice, Education, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Internal Security, and Interior.

But statements from Israel and the detailed 122- page report it provided are not the only forms of information available to the committee. They have received contrary information from a number of advocacy groups, such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Adalah: The Legal Center for Minority Rights in Israel, B'Tselem and Amnesty International, all of which detail a host of ways in which Israel is in violation of the UN treaty on discrimination.

In defense of the state, NGO Monitor, an Israeli-based group that tracks human rights organizations, submitted a report, in which it, in turn, attacked some of the claims made by the advocacy groups and gave additional context for some of the issues raised by such groups.

<title>Segregated Ethiopians to be moved</title>
<date>4/12/2007</date>
<content>
Petah Tikva Mayor Yitzhak Ohayon said Tuesday that the reported segregation of four Ethiopian pupils in the Lamerhav elementary school made his "blood boil," adding that the students would be transferred to other schools in the next few days.

"This sort of thing has never happened in the history of Petah Tikva. There is no other city that absorbs immigrants at our level and quality and this affair casts a shadow over the entire city and its inhabitants," said the mayor.

The placement of the Ethiopian girls in a separate class from their peers at the school was first reported by Yediot Aharonot.

According to the Lamerhav school principal, Rabbi Yeshiyahu Granevich, complete integration of the girls was impossible. The reason, according to municipal workers, was that the students were not observant enough, and their families did not belong to the national-religious movement that the school was founded upon.

One of the differences in the daily school life of the girls was that a single teacher was responsible to teach them all of their subjects. Worse yet, the four were allotted separate recess hours and were driven to and from school separately. Such action has been labeled by observers as "apartheid."

"I don't understand why they are doing this to us, just because we are black," one parent, who had noticed a drop in his daughter's mood and a lack of new friends told Daniel Oria, an active member of the Ethiopian community.

Oria told the newspaper that he tried to speak with the school's principal but was asked to leave.

After Oria's failed attempt, he filed a request with a municipal education official, asking him to bring an end to the alleged discrimination. In response, the official claimed that the institution was an "elitist school which believes that students must first learn how to behave and only then can be integrated."

A similar request made to Petah Tikva Deputy Mayor Paltiel Aisenthal, a member of NU/NRP, met with a like response when Aisenthal said that he could not understand why the parents were so worried when the school knew best how to treat the children. He added that their separation was not worrisome.

However, Education Minister Yuli Tamir was "astonished to hear about the phenomenon," claiming that the incident "has not been reported to the Education Ministry".

"This is racism," said Tamir, promising that if the allegations proved accurate, the ministry would "act severely."

<title>'Sharon intended to keep Kiryat Arba'</title>
<date>21/3/2007</date>
<content>
Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would have supported the decision by settlers to move into a large four-story apartment building along the main road that links the settlement of Kiryat Arba with the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Kadima MK Otniel Schneller told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday.

He is certain of this, Schneller said, because the two men met in the late afternoon of January 4, only hours before the former prime minister and the founder of the Kadima party suffered a massive stroke from which he has yet to regain consciousness.

The topic of the conversation was the future map of Israel, said Schneller, who himself is a centrist religious settler from Ma'aleh Michmash. He also acts as a liaison between the settlers and the Prime Minister's Office.

Schneller recalled how in that final short meeting, "we spoke about Hebron."

"He [Sharon] told me exactly what he would like to see in Hebron in the future." That vision included the settlement of Kiryat Arba and the area of Hebron around the ancient Biblical site, the Cave of the Patriarchs, now under Israeli control, said Schneller.

Sharon felt that the one-to-two kilometer area that links Kiryat Arba and the cave needed to be strengthened, recalled Schneller. Placing settlers in a large building overlooking the road between the two would do just that, he added.

As such, Schneller said, there was no question in his mind that retaining both Kiryat Arba and the Jewish area of Hebron was part of Kadima's platform.

"We will never give up the Cave of the Patriarchs. It belongs to us and only to us," said Schneller, who visited the settlers in Hebron on Tuesday in a show of solidarity.

The Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday refrained from responding to comments by Schneller regarding Kadima's policy on the matter.

Schneller himself cautioned that his support for the settlers was based on his assumption that the building belonged to the Hebron Jewish community.

David Wilder, a spokesman for that community, said that the 3,500 square meter stone structure had been purchased for $700,000 by the Jews of Hebron from the owner via a Jordanian office.

Palestinian Faiz Rajabi has rejected that claim. He said he owns the home and has the papers to prove it. "I gave the documents to the Israeli and Palestinian police," he told the Post.

This latest move by Hebron Jews marks the third time that the community has tried to expand to accommodate its population of 800, who live among some 30,000 Palestinians in an area under Israeli control.

In January of 2006, security forces prevented Jews from Hebron from expanding into empty stalls in the market place near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Later that spring, in May, they stopped Jews from moving into an empty Arab home in between the Avraham Avinu neighborhood and the cave.

Not to be deterred, settlers moved on Monday into the four-story structure in a Palestinian populated area along the central road that links Kiryat Arba with the Cave of the Patriarchs. Sitting in his office, in Hebron, Wilder said he was hopeful that this new attempt to strengthen the Jewish presence in Hebron would be more successful then the last two tries.

The Defense Ministry on Tuesday said it was still investigating the legal questions associated with the move. Currently, according to Defense Ministry sources, there was no plan to remove the settlers. Temporary International Presence in Hebron, an observer group, announced in a press release on Tuesday that the IDF informed them that "the settlers had bought the building from the Palestinian owner, and had a document to prove the ownership." But according to TIPH, it had not verified the information.

TIPH has asked the IDF to remove the settlers and to give them proof of purchase.

On Tuesday, Vice Premier Shimon Peres (Kadima) spoke out against the settlers in Hebron even as he, too, warned that the legality of the purchase must be examined.

The presence of settlers in Hebron has created "an unbearable situation" for both Israel and the Palestinians, said Peres.

But he declined to comment on whether Kiryat Arba should be included in a final settlement agreement. He said that at this point in time it was most important that the government "uphold the law." As such, he said, the legality of the issue needed to be examined.

But MK Taleb a-Sanaa (United Arab List) had already made up his mind with regard to his opposition on the matter. He called on the international community to boycott Israel over the Hebron house "like it boycotted South Africa during the apartheid era."

"The Israeli government is presenting itself as innocent while pointing a finger at the Palestinian government, when in fact it is Israel who is systematically violating international treaties," said a-Sanaa.

"The fact that the prime minister's aide, MK Otniel Schneller, is involved is proof that we are not talking about a horde of people, but about an act backed by the government."

MK Muhammad Barakei (Hadash) added that according to information he had collected from Arab residents of Hebron, there had been no deal to sell the house to the Jewish settlers and any proposed deal was "shady."

"This business in Hebron is not a real estate matter, it is a matter of occupation that must be gone from the city and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem," said Barakei.

Likud MK Gideon Sa'ar also said he believed that there was more at stake here than the building's ownership.

What is at stake is the right of Jews to live anywhere in Israel, especially in Hebron, which historically has almost always had a Jewish presence, said Sa'ar as he stood in the building in Hebron.

Sa'ar added that any attempt to harm the right of Jews to live in Hebron would strike a blow against the right of Jews to live everywhere in Israel.

But as politicians debated the matter, settlers from Hebron were busy on Tuesday moving into the structure that they call the Beit HaShalom (House of Peace), which is still under renovation and lacks electricity as well as other utilities.

Outside the building, Arab neighbors gathered to stare. Inside, religious girls wearing skirts over pants mopped floors in one area of the building designated for families. Handwritten signs with the families' names hung on the doorways.

In one room, a family had pitched a tent. Mattresses were spread out on the floor in another.

As they worked, three classes of religious schoolchildren met in another section of the building. They sat around large tables, studied and prayed.

Orit Struck, spokeswoman for the Hebron Jewish community, helped reporters and visitors tour the site. She led them up an unfinished stairwell onto a large open area floor that still needed tiles, walls, and windows.

"There is still a lot of work to do," she said, as she explained that the structure would eventually house a number of families.

She said she was pleased that the purchase of the home brought the Hebron Jews closer to Kiryat Arba. "If I lived here, my children could walk to school," she said as she pointed to the settlement located only a short distance away.

Sitting in her home in the Tel Rumaida area of Hebron, Miriam Grabovsky, who is six months pregnant, was already planning to move into the building with her husband and three small children.

She didn't mind, she said, that she was leaving an apartment to essentially camp out in the structure. It's not an issue, she said, of accommodations, but of heeding a higher calling and acting on God's will.

"If our presence there strengthens the right of Jews to live here and in Israel, then it's worth it," she said.

Herb Keinon and Yaakov Katz contributed to this report.

<title>Teachers heckle PM at TA conference</title>
<date>9/12/2007</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was heckled several times during a speech at the Israel Business Conference on Monday by several teachers who had gained access to the Tel Aviv venue.

In addition, hundreds of protesting teachers gathered outside the David Intercontinental Hotel where he conference was being held. The protesters blocked several streets in the area and police were working to maintain order. The teachers accused Olmert of abandoning their cause.

Earlier Tuesday, Secondary School Teachers Organization head Ran Erez warned of "anarchy" in the education establishment when the injunctions forcing secondary school teachers back to work become effective on Thursday.

Erez told Army Radio that many of the teachers would not want to return to work under duress and many pupils would not want to be taught by teachers who had been forced back to school. Erez added that the parents union intended to hold a strike.

"In actuality, even if 15 percent of parents strike, 20% of pupils don't come back and 30-40 % of teachers don't obey the injunction, there will be anarchy," said Erez.

Erez emphasized that while he would honor the back-to-work orders issued by the National Labor Court, "you can't force teachers to teach with handcuffs."

The SSTO head blasted the Finance Ministry for requesting that the injunctions be brought forward a few days for Arab teachers, accusing the ministry of wanting to "create apartheid between Jewish and Arab teachers."

Erez called on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to cancel the injunctions.

After nine weeks of the strike, the two met for the first time Sunday night for what was billed as a "conversation."

Erez said that in the meeting at the Prime Minister's Residence, Olmert refused to talk specifically about the strike and the negotiations but chose instead to discuss the longer-term future of the education establishment.

Erez "heard a lot of goodwill from the prime minister, but we'll see tomorrow if that translates into something practical," an SSTO spokesperson said Sunday.

On Monday, negotiations will continue between Erez and the directors-general of the Education and Finance ministries.

In the wake of the National Labor Court back-to-work order, Olmert said Sunday that he will be "personally involved" with the negotiations and that he "feels the distress of the teachers."

Meanwhile, as the senior lecturers' strike entered its 48th day on Monday, Finance Ministry and lecturers' representatives continued their negotiations at Bar Ilan University in order to end the crisis. Haifa University President Aaron Ben-Ze'ev described Sunday night's talks on the government's draft proposal as "serious."

In an interview with Army Radio, Ben-Ze'ev added that students would not "pay the price" for the strike of the Senior Lecturers Union.

University student unions have escalated their participation in the strike.

"The National Union of Israeli Students (NUIS) has decided to actively join the teachers' and lecturers' struggle before the semester is canceled and 100,000 students are hurt by it," said NUIS chairman Itay Shonshine on Sunday.

After one-day strikes last week at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University, the student union of the University of Haifa started an open-ended strike on Monday.

The strike was launched at a 10 a.m. rally at the university and included chaining the university campus shut and piling sandbags to block the entrances.

"We won't allow the studies to continue and we won't pay tuition until the education system in Israel is fixed," vowed University of Haifa Student Union head Yaniv Ben-Shushan on Sunday.

Meanwhile, the NUIS was set to hold a protest march Monday in Jerusalem that will begin at the Hebrew University's Givat Ram campus and proceed to the Finance Ministry. The marchers, both students and lecturers, will carry torches and light a hanukkia in front of the ministry building. "We will light the seventh candle of Hanukka as a symbol for returning the light of the future of higher education in Israel," said Shonshine of the planned march.

Tuesday will see a massive rally at Tel Aviv University's Antin Square at noon, uniting lecturers and students in a call to "end the apathy and return to our studies." It will be followed on Wednesday by a morning rally at Beersheba's Ben-Gurion University.

<title>Think Again: The end of the bargain</title>
<date>18/10/2007</date>
<content>
The historic bargain linking American Jewry and Israel since the founding of the state is coming to an end. The terms of the deal were unspoken, but clear: Israel would provide American Jews with a sense of pride and identity as Jews, and they, in turn, would shower upon Israel their financial and political support. But Israel is no longer a source of pride for non-Orthodox Jews, and the identity it provides is not one which they wish to share.

That conclusion emerges from "Beyond Distancing: Young Adult American Jews and Their Alienation from Israel," a recent study published under the auspices of the The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies by sociologists Steven M. Cohen and Ari Y. Kelman. They found that American Jews under 35 do not care very much about Israel. They are not just apathetic about Israel; that indifference is "giving way to downright alienation," write Cohen and Kelman.

More than half of Jews under 35 said that they would not view the destruction of Israel as a personal tragedy. The death and expulsion of millions is something they could live with. By those standards, they probably would not see the Holocaust as a "personal" tragedy either.

What young Jews under 35 feel toward Israel goes beyond apathy to outright resentment. Israel complicates their social lives and muddies their political identity. Only 54 percent profess to be comfortable with the idea of a Jewish state at all. In Europe and on elite American campuses, internationalism and a world-without-borders are the rage. The Jews of Israel, with their stubborn insistence on protecting their nation-state, are, as always, out-of-sync.

Young American Jews do not wish to be tarred with such atavisms. On campus and where enlightened folk meet, Israel is scorned as a colonial oppressor. Who wants to be identified as a sympathizer with "apartheid"? Once Reform Judaism disavowed Zionism for fear of being thought disloyal to its host countries, and young American Jews today share similar fears of being out of step with their enlightened peers.

MOLLY UMBERGER, whose mother is program director of the leftist New Israel Fund (NIF), told The Jerusalem Post that she views both Israel and the Palestinians as having made lots of mistakes and the situation as complicated, but generally "tries not to think about [Israel]." No wonder when Bruce Temkin, the director of the NIF, describes Israel as a "turn-off." Daniel Alperin, 33, describes his interest in Israel as waning when he began to hear "the bad stuff" - probably about the time he entered college.

Already the trend lines were pointing in this direction 40 years ago. In a 1965 Commentary symposium of younger Jewish intellectuals - the least religiously identified segment of American Jewry - only one expressed complete comfort with Israel's creation and pride in its accomplishments, and he eventually made aliya. The rest expressed various degrees of discomfort with Israel's militarism (and this was before 1967 and the "occupation"). The only Jewish identity they acknowledged at all was that of the "Jew" as the perpetually alienated critic of those in power - not exactly one upon which to base a connection to other Jews. Now the rest of American Jewry is catching up to those once young intellectuals.

JEWISH AGENCY Chairman Ze'ev Bielski labeled the results "very distressing," and then proceeded to give a ridiculous explanation for those numbers: the comfortable life of most American Jews.

Cohen and Kelman know better. And their answer is summed up in the demographic they did not interview for their study: Orthodox Jews. For a survey of young Orthodox Jews would have yielded a diametrically opposite result.

Younger Jews, those for whom their Judaism is important - primarily the Orthodox - will remain connected to the fate of their fellow Jews in Israel. Most Orthodox American youth will study in Israel after high school, some for many years. And almost all will visit Israel many times. Eretz Yisrael is not a mere abstraction for them, but the center of the spiritual life of the Jewish people.

Even an anti-Zionist Satmar hassid living in the secluded village of Monroe will intensify his prayers when Israel is at war and follow the action closely. Why? Because for him the name Jew means something.

THE MAJORITY of young American Jews and the majority of young Israelis share in common a lack of interest in their Judaism. That shared negativity, however, provides little basis for a relationship. Shared gene pools won't do it either - that smacks of racism. And ethnic identity, it turns out, cannot be passed down or survive the breakup of ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods.

But the survey signals something else as well: a declining understanding on the part of American Jews of Judaism in terms of a national identity that imposes obligations to one's co-nationals. That is being replaced by a return to the self-definition of classic German Reform: German (or in this case American) nationals of the Mosaic persuasion.

THE IMPACT of the declining sense of responsibility to one's fellow Jews is being felt within American Jewry itself, not just in attitudes toward Israel. Already only 6% of giving by mega-Jewish foundations goes to remotely Jewish causes. It is hardly surprising, for instance, that non-Jewish spouses are not eager to contribute to Jewish causes. In time, funding the institutions of American Jewry will become ever more difficult. And the Orthodox will be left to donate to Israel.

The political implications for Israel are large as well. Fortunately, Professors Walt and Mearsheimer are wrong about an Israel lobby comprised mostly of those with Jewish-sounding names. It is devout Christians, and not some nefarious Israel lobby, which is the primary bulwark of American support for Israel today. That we have to rely on Christian political support, rather than our fellow Jews, however, is a very mixed blessing indeed.

<title>Think tank takes on 'gender apartheid' in Muslim world</title>
<date>10/7/2007</date>

A conservative Jerusalem think tank is working to focus attention on the lack of women's rights and religious freedom in the Muslim world, in an attempt to combat Islamic extremism.

"The issue of women's rights in the Muslim world is of critical importance, because it serves to delegitimize and destabilize radical Islam in the Muslim world, where the issue of male dominance is a fundamental feature of society," said Dr. Martin Sherman, academic director of The Jerusalem Summit.

The Tel Aviv University political scientist said that a public struggle against "gender and creed apartheid" in the Muslim world would be effective in that it would be "using political correctness against those who hide behind it."

The small, secular think tank was established four years ago with funding from Russian oligarch Michael Cherney, who immigrated to Israel in 1994. The Jerusalem Summit is teaming up with evangelical Christians around the world on the issue.

"What we are trying to show is not just that Israel is not an apartheid state, but that Islamist society is in fact an apartheid empire," said the group's executive director, Dmitry Radyshevsky. He said it was high time Israel went on the diplomatic offensive.

A campaign by the West against Islamic fundamentalism on this issue coupled with a focus on the persecution of religious minorities in the Muslim world could cause these two central pillars of totalitarian Islamic ideology to crumble, he said.

The Moscow-born Radyshevsky said that just as the Soviet empire seemed invincible a quarter century ago, Islamic extremism could be weakened over time by such a political campaign.

The issue of women is "a major cleavage line" and "the soft underbelly" of Islamic society that could be part of a strategic initiative against Islamic extremism to include funding organizations advocating women's rights in Muslim countries, sanctioning countries that violate women's rights, and conditioning foreign aid and trade on the issue, Sherman said.

Representatives of the Jerusalem Summit have met with parliamentarians and religious leaders in the Philippines, South Korea, South Africa and Singapore, as well as members of the House of Lords, with additional events planned in Japan and Ukraine.

The think tank is reaching out to evangelical Christians around the world - especially via conferences in Europe, Africa and Asia - in coordination with the Knesset's increasingly influential Christian Allies Caucus, the parliamentary lobby that works with Christians supporters of Israel around the world.

"In the fight against radical Islam, evangelical Christians are the only group with the spiritual energy, numerical mass and moral resolve to confront Islamic extremism," said Sherman, who was born in South Africa and educated in a Catholic school in Johannesburg.

Radyshevsky, a graduate of Harvard University's Divinity School, said he envisioned The Jerusalem Summit as a counterweight to a slew of Islamic and Arab forums, as well as the far-left Israeli group Peace Now, and as a pro-Israel international forum of Biblical civilization.

The think tank, whose motto is: "A neo-Zionist response to post-Zionist appeasement," will start holding seminars for Israeli university students in Jerusalem this fall, in an effort to buttress Israel's PR efforts on campuses abroad.

The nine-month seminars, which will be held in English, will meet once a week and include briefings by media and academic experts.

<title>UNHRC to vote on anti-Israel measure</title>
<date>24/9/2007</date>
<content>
The United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva is set to vote this week on an anti-Israel resolution, even though its own investigator says the issue is "obsolete."

The measure would condemn Israel for banning a fact-finding mission to investigate IDF activities in Gaza in the summer of 2006, including the shelling of the Strip's sole power station. It calls for Israel to allow the entry of such a mission to explore the arm actions following the kidnapping of Cpl. Gilad Schalit just outside Gaza on June 25, 2006.

The motion is likely to come to a vote at the end of the week, even though the council's Special Rapporteur John Dugard told the human rights body in August that the matter was "obsolete" and "impractical."

Dugard said security concerns would prevent such a mission at this time.

And the resolution, Dugard wrote in a report to the council, "was seriously flawed" by reason of its failure to stipulate which facts were to be investigated.

Dugard, who would have led the probe, said he was meant to focus on Israel's shelling of the Gaza power plant, which has since been repaired.

Lastly, he said that in visits to Israel over the past year, he had investigated IDF actions in Gaza in the summer and fall of 2006, and presented those findings to the council.

There was no need, he said, for a special fact-finding mission to explore a matter he has already investigated. Dugard even quoted Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Yitzhak Levanon, when he said the resolution had "already been effectively realized."

As part of that work, Dugard said, he also investigated the IDF shelling of Beit Hanun in northeast Gaza in November 2006, in which 19 Palestinian civilians were killed.

As part of the anti-Israel resolution, the Human Rights Council also plans to ask that Israel allow a fact-finding mission on this matter, as well, and to take Israel to task for failing to grant entry last December to the initial investigatory team headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.

Last Thursday, Levanon told the council that its actions "continue to defy practical wisdom."

The members, he said, "[knew] perfectly well that the Reverend Tutu has advised the presidency he cannot fulfill such mission now for personal reasons."

Levanon later told The Jerusalem Post that at the time, Tutu hadn't needed permission from Israel to enter Gaza, since he could have done so through Egypt.

"It seems those who stand behind this resolution do not really care about what happened on the ground. Their only desire is to continue with their unending odyssey of bashing a single UN member state," Levanon told the council. "Its sponsors insist on investigating incidents which have already been investigated while resolutely disregarding the reality on the ground, such as ongoing violations of human rights in Gaza by the Palestinians."

Levanon also blasted the council's decision, taken at its last meeting, to hold a special debate on Israel during each session. He called it a "flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of equality."

As part of the council's ongoing investigation of the Israel, Dugard is due to arrive in Israel on Tuesday for a weeklong visit to report on the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians in the territories.

A prominent South African professor of international law, Dugard has served as a judge on the International Court of Justice and as "special rapporteur" for both the UN Commission on Human Rights and the International Law Commission.

He is an expert on apartheid.

Dugard holds the post of permanent investigator of Israeli actions in the territories. In the past, he has been criticized for comparing Israeli actions there with apartheid.

<title>Israeli moderates, resist</title>
<date>Mon Jul 01 06:46:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
We continue to debate the travels of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the necessity of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel, the deterioration of the middle class, the character of Iran’s new president. Those are all important issues, some of them even existential. But we don’t notice that while we preoccupy ourselves with the problems of the present, right-wing groups in the Knesset are trying to change the parameters of the equation whereby Israel is a Jewish and a democratic state. Once-ubiquitous expressions used to describe Israel, such as “a Jewish state” or “a state with a Zionist orientation,” are undergoing a tremendous metamorphosis, and we turn a blind eye and think it only a semantic change which may not even be possible to implement.
The State of Israel was established as a refuge for the Jewish people, to give it the right to self-determination that had been denied to it. But the public agreement was for a state that represents a moderate, tolerant and determined Judaism. Groups on the right and among the settlers tend to characterize Israel as a state that represents the essence of their Judaism, in which only lip service is paid to democracy. Already in the previous Knesset, legislators proposed ultranationalist laws but were blocked by then-Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor and company.
Make no mistake: There is a group in the Knesset that seeks to change the formula of Israel’s being a Jewish and a democratic state. But MKs with identical goals do not join forces without a determined leader. MK Yariv Levin ‏(Likud-Yisrael Beiteinu‏) was not anointed by his party colleagues, MKs Zeev Elkin and Danny Danon, but he is the real leader of the unrestrained approach, filled with hatred for the legal system.
The prime minister stands at the sidelines, as a neutral observer. He does not offer the nation a vision and a path, but he avoids confrontation with the out-of-control unbridled MKs. Some call this fate, since after all some elements of the nation do not rule out apartheid as a system. They are prevented from saying this outright only out of concern that it could cause harm to the state. But these are not majority opinions. Large sections of the public prefer Benjamin Netanyahu over other possible heads of government, but would prefer that government itself to be more moderate. The fact that Netanyahu is the lesser of the evils indicates the direction in which the pendulum is now swinging.
But Netanyahu’s election was not an automatic vote of public confidence in Danon and in another party colleague, MK Moshe Feiglin. The settlers, the religious Zionist camp and their supporters are the minority. There is no majority for their views, nor for the pseudo-liberal disguise donned by Economy Minister Naftali Bennett of Habayit Hayehudi in the election. The opposing camp is split mainly over socioeconomic issues, but the electorate behind all of the more moderate parties wholeheartedly objects to the interpretation of Judaism and democracy offered by Levin and by MK Ayelet Shaked ‏(Habayit Hayehudi‏).
Before the next election we should consider a broad coalition of political forces from all the center and left parties, of people like Meridor and company and leaders of public opinion from the economic, media, military and academic spheres. The creation of an alternative requires great finesse, and there are many seemingly impassable obstacles to be overcome. This can happen if more important individuals and groups within society come to realize that this is a battle for the soul and the future direction of Israel.

Admit it: Egypt has us stumped
It would be helpful if we could all admit to honest ambivalences about Egypt. On one side is the “new beginning,” renewing the 2011 youthful revolution and human rights cause. Notably most women have been in the anti-Morsi crowds; almost everyone visible for the Brotherhood appear to be men. And Morsi as an Islamist was possibly trying to theocratize rather than democratize Egypt.
Rarely noted is the unacceptability of Islamists describing democracy as a concession and compromise rather than one of their core beliefs. This violates the UN Charter, UN Declaration of Human Rights, and every modern political value.Also, before Islamism, the other major ideologies that failed to incorporate democracy as core beliefs were Communism, Fascism, Nazism, KKK-like Southern Jim Crow segregation and South African Apartheid. Another is Kahanism. So while we must be concerned about how the change will affect Islamists ‏(everywhere‏), we must also be concerned that this very concern is itself, by default, a kind of submission to extremist blackmail.
On the other side are worries about the arguable basic unfairness of the revocation of a free election − that while Morsi was possibly trying to theocratize Egypt or make Brotherhood rule permanent, this was never unequivocally clear enough to overturn a free election, and moreover he had done nothing evil or criminal; about the practical effect everywhere on Islamist acceptance of democracy − even if worrying about this is, again, a form of submission to extremist blackmail; about further violence and polarization; and about the fate of democracy in the Islamic world.
If only, even at the cost of personal discomfort, we could live with ambiguity, and admit to uncertainty.

From ‘the Zionist dream’ to the oligarchs
In response to “Russia’s blue-and-white oligarchs” ‏(Asher Schechter, July 5‏).
Oligarchy − government by a small group of people. That’s in the dictionary. When I read this article, I was not only repelled but distressed; could these guys eventually “govern” us?
I was a fighter in the U.K. for the freedom of Jews in the former U.S.S.R. from 1968-78. I continued my activities in Israel until the first group of refuseniks came out in 1987. Consequently I feel a sense of pride that I have contributed to this significant aliyah, notwithstanding that its full effect has yet to be felt.
Since we have a high-profile group of our own “oligarchs” encouraged by our government, its time to seriously think about where they and the wannabees are aiming to take us. After all, money is power.
I wonder what Herzl, Jabotinsky, Ben-Gurion and Eshkol, not to mention the other Zionist, pioneering leaders who were here when I first arrived in Israel in 1949, would think about it all.
Can anyone remember what “the Zionist dream” was?

<title>EU guidelines: a point of no return</title>
<date>Thu Jul 18 17:17:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The panicky voices in Jerusalem are no negligible thing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett understand that something important has happened in Europe. The barrier has been breached. The first sanctions have been imposed, so now it's only a matter of time until more serious and painful sanctions hit. Have we mentioned South Africa?
For decades the Europeans only talked and threatened. For decades they were led astray by our right-wing governments that promised negotiations and a construction freeze in the settlements. This time the Europeans got tired and took action; they're stopping funding, grants and awards to any Israeli entity linked to the settlements.
That's why people on the right are so angry. That's why they're so upset. They understand that the troubles will begin in our pockets. They understand that when the public feels the sanctions in the form of lower salaries, rising prices and increasing unemployment, it will realize that it's impossible to fool all the world all the time.
It was amusing to hear the reactions of peace advocates Netanyahu, Lieberman and Bennett. Netanyahu hastened to say that the Europeans' step "undermines efforts to renew the diplomatic process." After all, he's a famous peace advocate whose whole objective is to sign an agreement with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. That's why he ran in the election last January. And now those anti-Semitic Europeans are sabotaging his efforts.
No less amusing was Lieberman's reaction: "This is a final blow to the chances of renewing the peace process." He's also a famous peace advocate and an indefatigable opponent of land confiscation and illegal construction in the territories. Actually, he's an expert at making any possibility of compromise impossible.
Bennett, too, has a sense of humor. He went on the air and bemoaned the "economic terror attack" that has "destroyed any possibility of negotiations." But he immediately added that we don't have to be upset by the sanctions because "trade with the world is only increasing because the world needs the Jewish mind." How much arrogance and chutzpah do you need to believe that only we have the brains and the goyim can't exist without us?
Bennett has lost himself in an imaginary world in which China, the United States and Europe are dependent on us, rather than the other way around. It's a world in which we sell fighter planes to the United States and rescue it from sanctions at the United Nations.
In this miraculous world, our situation is constantly improving. Bennett has not heard, for example, about the decision (since rejected) by European banks to ban loans to Israeli companies that operate in the territories. That was considered as part of an ethics review, a process that has become a norm at European companies.
Bennett hasn't heard about the consumer unions that boycott Israeli products because of the occupation. They demonstrated outside supermarkets until several retailers in Europe and the United States stopped carrying Israeli products.
Nor is Bennett aware of large European trade unions that advise their members not to buy Israeli products. And he hasn't heard about trade unions at European ports that refuse to unload cargo from ships that fly the blue and white. Nobody told him about European companies that shun Israeli companies due to the "Israel risk" – code for the occupation and its consequences. These groups are aware that Israel is dependent on exports, and they mention the boycott that brought down the apartheid regime in South Africa.
In 2009 the Norwegian government announced that it was excluding Elbit Systems from its pension fund, citing the company's part in building the separation fence. The fund also announced that it was dropping real estate developer Africa Israel, citing construction in the occupied territories.
This is the first breach in the barrier. Later the sanctions and boycotts will intensify until they hit us all hard in our pockets. Even Bennett will understand that.

<title>Scrap the so-called Jewish state law</title>
<date>Tue Oct 22 03:32:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The only way Israel can exist as a democratic Jewish state is by being a democratic state whose citizens have equal rights, but where the majority of its population is Jewish.
Ensuring such a majority is not self-evident, but in view of the current Jewish majority of four-fifths, it is possible - provided that Israel sees this as the fundamental issue, rather than annexing territories with hundreds of thousands of Palestinian residents - as it has done in Jerusalem.
Maintaining the majority in a democracy cannot be done by means of discriminatory legislation. The Law of Return, although intended for Jews, does not discriminate among the state's citizens. It is intended for those who are not citizens.
However, the amendment to the Citizenship Law - which prevents Israelis from forming a family in Israel with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza - is discriminatory. This is because it is only Arab Israelis who are expected to ask to form such a family. The state did not dare say the reason for such a law is the need to ensure a Jewish majority, for fear it would be disqualified by the Supreme Court. Instead, the state argued that the reason for the law was security, which the High Court of Justice accepted by a majority vote.
Prof. Ruth Gavison refused to take part in this pretense. She justified the law, citing the need to ensure a Jewish majority, even at the expense of infringing on democracy and equal rights. Prof. Gavison has now been asked by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni to draft a proposal for a constitutional arrangement dealing with the character of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state (the so-called "Basic Law: Jewish nation state") that the coalition government partners agreed to enact, and that should combine and balance these two values of Jewish and democratic.
The first proposal for such Basic Law, sponsored in the previous Knesset by MK Avi Dichter (Kadima), showed such legislation was not possible without infringing on the equality before the law. So does the current proposal, sponsored by MK Yariv Levin (Likud-Yisrael Beiteinu) and MK Ayelet Shaked (Habayit Hayehudi).
But this is the law's intention: to subject the state's democratic values to its being "Jewish". The legislators are conspiring against the Arab minority, a fifth of the state's population, but not only against it. The pressure for this legislation must be seen as preparation for a much larger Palestinian population in Israel, after it annexes the West Bank territories. This is what the proposers want.
There is no need for a new Jewish nation state law that compromises equality and leads Israel towards apartheid. The right direction for Israel to take is clear, and the prime minister understands it. Israel must set borders within which it has a Jewish majority and move to integrate its Arab citizens. The idea of a Jewish state law, in any possible version, works in the opposite direction and must be scrapped.

<title>The price of deception and apartheid</title>
<date>Wed Nov 27 06:09:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Despite the compromise that Justice Minister Tzipi Livni reached on Tuesday with the European Union’s foreign minister, Catherine Ashton, over the Horizon 2020 scientific cooperation agreement, Israel is now beginning to pay the price of its deeds in the occupied territories.
Four years after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech at Bar-Ilan University, in which he recognized the principle of two states but nevertheless refused to stop construction in the settlements - following the government’s extremist statements and decisions to build thousands of housing units in the settlements; and following Israel’s ongoing harassment of Palestinian residents of the territories - the international community is beginning to take practical measures against Israel’s tactics of deception and the apartheid it practices toward the Palestinians.
In July, the European Commission published new guidelines that forbid European Union agencies and foundations to give grants or loans to Israeli bodies connected in any way to activity in the territories. These guidelines complicated the finalization of the Horizon 2020 agreement, as the European Union rejected most of Israel’s compromise proposals. This scientific cooperation agreement is expected to bring hundreds of millions of euros to Israeli research institutes and high-tech companies, so, had Israel not signed it, the result would have been a loss of NIS 2.5 billion for the research and development community.
In light of this expected loss, Livni conducted marathon negotiations with Ashton by telephone on Tuesday. The compromise that they reached deals mainly with how the money expected to flow from the European Union will be “fenced off” to ensure it doesn’t reach the settlements in any way. Though any Israeli entity that operates within the Green Line will be able to submit a request for European funding, it will need to develop a mechanism to ensure that any money it receives from the European Union is invested only in activities conducted inside the Green Line.
Despite the retreat from its initial refusal to compromise, the European Union is making an important contribution to Israel’s future by its determined stance against transferring money to the settlements. The settlement enterprise has turned Israel into an immoral state whose policies are unacceptable to the world of which it seeks to be part. It’s regrettable that the government hasn’t understood this on its own, but the international community must make this clear to it.
What the European Union, and essentially the entire world, is seeking is crystal clear: the reinstatement of the Green Line as the line that divides Israel from the occupied territories. Anything else will impose heavy economic, diplomatic and scientific costs.

<title>Netanyahu's symbolic absence</title>
<date>Wed Dec 11 04:10:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to start curtailing his exorbitant expenditures, which are publicized from time to time and generally spark public outrage. But it’s too bad that the very first cut he opted to make resulted in Nelson Mandela’s funeral – an event that drew most of the world’s leaders, from presidents of the United States and European countries to leaders of controversial states like Iran – taking place without the participation of a senior Israeli representative.
Given the generous budget for travel and other expenditures that has characterized all of Netanyahu’s terms as prime minister (just last year, for instance, he insisted on flying in a specially-chartered plane to the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), and given that Mandela’s doctrine and legacy (in contrast to those of Thatcher) are evidently not the pillar of fire that guides Netanyahu, it’s not unreasonable to suspect that the spending issue provided Netanyahu with a pretext to escape a vexing event he didn’t want to participate in.
Mandela, in both life and death, symbolized the idea of equality among all human beings and opposition to the apartheid regime, which subjected people to different laws based on race or ethnicity. Israel under Netanyahu’s leadership, in which segregation, racist legislation and discrimination on the basis of nationality are flourishing virtually undisturbed, cannot say it respects Mandela’s heritage, nor can it join the family of nations whose flagship values are the striving for civil equality and the fight against racism.
Mandela spoke out in the past in favor of the Palestinian struggle – something that earned him no points with Netanyahu, who sees the Palestinians as demonic enemies with whom there is no possibility of dialogue. It’s also possible to infer that the core of Mandela’s struggle – the war on racism against blacks – doesn’t burn in the Israeli prime minister’s bones, since just this week Netanyahu and his coalition partners were busy passing the so-called Infiltration Law, which allows people to be jailed for up to a year without trial, and is aimed primarily at African migrants.
The absence of Israel’s senior leadership from Mandela’s funeral is no accident, and it can be seen as a symbol of Israel’s increasing diplomatic isolation. Israel is gradually being evicted from the international community because of its insistence on continuing the occupation and even reinforcing it via more and more settlements, while turning its back on diplomatic processes and initiatives. This situation, whose implications first began making themselves felt in the negotiations over the Horizon 2020 scientific cooperation agreement, endangers Israel no less, and perhaps even more, than the plethora of regional threats that worry Netanyahu, and about which he is constantly warning.

<title>Lapid, for Israel's sake, break with Bennett</title>
<date>Thu Dec 12 06:02:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
The alliance between the “brothers” Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, which was forged in order to form a coalition, has helped Bennett and his Habayit Hayehudi party portray themselves to the Israeli public as a young, innovative, liberal alternative. But after less than a year in the government, cracks have formed in this alliance, and they recently widened to the point of an open break. Habayit Hayehudi’s true face is gradually being revealed: It’s not a party of “high-tech” or “new politics,” but a nationalist, conservative religious movement that stands for apartheid, discrimination, occupation and preserving the religious-civic status quo, which makes life difficult for most Israelis.
This alliance has made some of Lapid’s voters feel cheated, since they see that their votes have ultimately strengthened the rule of extremist settlers in the form of MKs Uri Ariel and Orit Strock. Now that Habayit Hayehudi has blocked all the bills Yesh Atid proposed to sever the connection between the Jewish religion and civic life – tax credits for gay parents, preventing discrimination against homosexuals on issues such as obtaining mortgages, and a reform of Israel’s divorce laws – it seems the time has come to put an end to this alliance.
Yesh Atid’s parliamentary activism on issues of separating religion from state reflects Lapid’s belated realization that his voters didn’t elect him to protect the settlements of Beit El, Elkana and Givat Assaf, but to protect their own right to live in a democratic state governed by liberal rather than religious law. Bennett, the economy minister, talks a lot about innovation and progress, on the basis of his experience as a high-tech entrepreneur. But by turning its back on every initiative and reform related to core Israeli concerns in the diplomatic and civic arenas, his party has exemplified the exact opposite.
The Israeli public – including those Israelis who don’t hate religion but rather integrate religious customs into their lives – is ripe for civic reforms that would sever the connection between religion and state, which no government has ever dared try to unravel. It is even demanding such reforms.
Lapid must continue the trend of distancing himself from Bennett that he has begun, and advance the civic reforms necessary to bring Israel into line with the world’s liberal democracies, in which personal matters such as the choice of a partner, and the method of marriage, divorce and burial are left up to the individual’s choice. He must break with Bennett.

<title>Time to ask South Africa for forgiveness</title>
<date>Sun Dec 15 01:07:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
DURBAN - At the time I didn’t know anything; it didn’t interest me and I didn’t want to know. Some of Israel’s most senior journalists had traveled to South Africa as guests of the apartheid government, which wined and dined them, to which they responded in kind, with complimentary stories; to this day, most of them don’t see anything wrong with that. At the time I was jealous that I hadn’t been invited; I was a good Tel Avivian who, like the overwhelming majority of Israelis, didn’t see anything wrong with apartheid or with the relations my country had with South Africa.
The apartheid prime minister and some members of his cabinet came to the Israel of Yitzhak Rabin (and Shimon Peres), the one they remember so fondly now – another chapter of the “Rabin Legacy” – and they were granted a reception here that they would not have received in any other country; Israel Aircraft Industries made some huge deals with South Africa that “saved” the company, as Aluf Benn recently revealed here, as did other Israeli weapons manufacturers. Foreign reports have revealed nuclear cooperation, with the defense minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, quoted as saying that Israel had to supply more weapons to its fellow “leper” state, in order to “stop communism,” which certainly sounds possible.
In Europe, hundreds of thousands of young people had taken to the streets in protest against apartheid and to call for the release of Nelson Mandela, while here there was shameful silence and embarrassing weapons deals.
Some radical left-wing organizations tried to protest, and their protests were greeted with the standard delegitimization. My colleague at Army Radio, Yoav Karni, tried to raise a storm, and was considered a troublemaker. Yossi Beilin then tried to take action as director-general of the Foreign Ministry, and he was also considered a troublemaker, someone who understood nothing about “interests” and “security,” until he succeeded in making some, albeit small, change in policy.
For several years, Israel was the most loyal ally of that South Africa, the only democracy that did not join the sanctions regime until it was forced to do so under American pressure, and it’s doubtful whether it really observed the sanctions (one must consider what Israel would say today about a country that didn’t join the sanctions against Iran). Even the support that the white regime had given to Nazi Germany didn’t deter Israel. Weapons, weapons, you shall sell.
And we – all Israelis, except for a few select individuals, were silent. We supported and were even proud of our despicable ally. When talking about brainwashing and the terrible blindness in Israeli society, we need to remember this, too. When we speak about Mandela, we must not forget this. We were practically the only country that traded and supported and trained and sold and bought and built and conducted experiments with it – overtly and covertly, a friend of the department, the department of evil. We were members of the same cohort -- lo and behold, the apartheid regime and Israel were established in the same year – and Israel found itself a host of justifications as part of the fellowship of justifications. It upheld a covenant of two representatives of enlightened minorities standing in the breach against dark and wild majorities, both justifying their actions with religious and messianic arguments. The biblical Amnon and Tamar, Israel and South Africa.
We have to remember this now, but it’s not enough. I’m writing these lines from the Eastern Cape of South Africa, en route to Qunu, to cover Mandela’s interment there today. Neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor President Shimon Peres will be at the ceremony. What else is there to say about someone who saw attending British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s funeral as more important than attending Mandela’s, and about Peres, who, of all the trips he’s taken, was unable to make this one.
But there is something much more important than participating in ceremonies that Israel should have done long ago. Israel should have begged Mandela’s forgiveness in his lifetime, and must apologize to South Africa at any time. It’s not too late. Mandela forgave Israel, but Israel must not forgive itself. Now, as the world bows its head in such an impressive manner before Mandela’s achievements, the prime minister must apologize for the shameful collaboration, for the arms deals, and for the indifference and moral obtuseness. Sometimes a country may also ask forgiveness, and in this case, it’s even required.

<title>Emergency order forever </title>
<date>Thu Apr 25 02:53:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
You have to be a former Shin Bet head to say Israel is putting its future at risk by not making a real effort to integrate its Arab citizens, nor advancing their status and solidarity with the state.
When a current Shin Bet chief is asked for his opinion, the easy default option is to say that permitting Israeli Arabs to raise a family with a spouse from the West Bank or Gaza Strip potentially poses a high risk to the country's security and its people's safety.
Thus, with the backing of the Shin Bet's opinion, the Knesset extended on Tuesday the emergency order denying residency in Israel to male spouses under 35 and female spouses under 25 who hail from the West Bank, Gaza or enemy states. In other words, the ban applies to Arabs from outside Israel in their marriageable prime. The emergency order from 2003 has now entered its 11th year.
On the face of it, the order also applies to Jews who want to raise a family with Palestinians from the West Bank or Gaza. But there are hardly any such cases. In contrast, the natural reserve of partners for Israeli Arabs is among their people in the West Bank and Gaza. Hence, the order clearly infringes on Israeli Arabs' right to set up a family with their chosen partner and live in Israel.
Preventing a citizen from living in his country with his or her chosen spouse is a severe infringement of a basic civil right, whose protection is one of the reasons for maintaining a democracy. An order directed exclusively against the Arabs strengthens the argument that Israel is a discriminatory apartheid state.
The Shin Bet's job is to enable Israelis to live in safety in an environment ensuring their civil rights. The way to achieve this cannot be through sweeping discrimination against Palestinian citizens. Rather, it should be achieved by vetting each candidate for family unification individually, as the security service knows how to do.
The Shin Bet gave the cabinet an opinion that appeased the politicians, whose motives are demographic, and harmed Israel's security by entrenching the inequality between Jews and Arabs.
Labor MKs who supported the emergency order - Omer Bar-Lev, Hilik Bar, Moshe Mizrahi, Erel Margalit, Miki Rosenthal, Nachman Shai and Itzik Shmuli - continue the disgraceful tradition of supporting nationalist, discriminatory laws. Such support liquidated the Kadima Party. Such votes will not lead Labor to power, except perhaps as a spear-carrier.

 Sharing the burden: no mere slogan

	With all the talk in the news and all the speculation surrounding coalition talks, I’d like to add my take on the slogan “Sharing the burden.” I think every citizen of this country is entitled to privileges, but these privileges come with obligations. We should all make a contribution to the state, to our welfare and to upholding democratic institutions.
                
	With all due respect to the religious parties, they are not democratic and do not contribute to safeguarding or advancing our very precious democracy. On the contrary; they are mainly led by rabbis who have held sway over our lives via the Interior, Health, Housing and the Religious Affairs Ministries, not to mention the Chief Rabbinate. These parties are takers, not givers, and we have encouraged them to take by cultivating a growing population of “entitled ones.”
                
	“Sharing the burden” includes several aspects that are cardinal to our democratic life here, the least important of which is army service. First and foremost is education: we need a uniform education system for all. Currently, we have secular, religious Zionist, schools for Haredi boys, schools for Haredi girls and education for the Arab population − five separate systems for fewer than 8 million citizens.
                
	After our boys and girls complete their army service and go on to university or college, they have huge tuition costs; many work and study at the same time. Religious boys go to yeshivas or kollels; not only are they paid for by the state, but these “students” are paid to study! With education comes joining the work force, paying taxes and reaping the benefits of working. At the moment, some religious citizens work, but many more don’t, or do “gray” work and avoid paying taxes.
                
	Then there is the issue of civil service. There is no shortage of places for Israelis, including the religious and Arab sectors, to contribute − for the country and for their communities. After these requirements have been filled, then we can look to army service and examining how enlisting Haredi youth will change the fabric of the military.
                
	Yes, it’s time to “share the burden,” but we must examine exactly how this is to be accomplished − and the sooner the better.

	In response to “As Lincoln abolished slavery, Israel must abolish occupation” ‏(Bradley Burston, February 26‏)
                
	Bradley Burston says that “as Lincoln abolished slavery, Israel must abolish the occupation.” These evils, which are otherwise so different, are similar in that they have needed to be literally, and not just figuratively, abolished.
                
	But Burston’s metaphoric analogies to Lincoln’s issue are also striking − the Palestinians’ lack of rights, dispossession, that they are beaten, shot and jailed, sometimes it seems almost at will − and that their families are split by artificial boundaries, and with ancient Biblical justifications.
                
	Lincoln famously said, in 1858, “A house divided against itself cannot stand” and “cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.”
                
	Israel is such a house − Israel proper and the occupied territories; free and occupied; pro-freedom and pro-occupation. But Israel will be one house, either based on its 1967 borders or as an annexationist “Greater Israel.”
                
	Lincoln spoke against Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas, who advocated “popular sovereignty,” where each new state’s free population could vote to be a slave or a free state.
                
	Israel is a democracy in Israel proper and when decisions refer to it; but not when it decides in favor of occupation. Palestinian freedom is inalienable and not decidable. When others decide, we have Senator Stephen Douglas’s sovereignty proposal all over again. In the occupied territories itself, Israel is no more ‏(or less‏) democratic than the slave South, apartheid South Africa or the segregationist South.
                
	Lincoln opposed the Dred Scott decision ‏(1857‏) of his Supreme Court, according to which blacks had no constitutional protections or citizenship, which also recalls the Plessy v. Ferguson decision ‏(1896‏) for “separate but equal” segregation.
                
	These legalistic rationalizations of oppression − also like the Levy Report − would be denounced by Hebrew prophets like Amos and Micah, by America’s founders fighting Britain’s “legal” Empire, and by Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, David Ben-Gurion and also Ariel Sharon.
                
	As Burston says, Israel must abolish its own expansionist and oppressive decrees to act in the spirit of the Hebrew prophets of righteousness and of the biblical Abraham’s most renowned namesake, Abraham Lincoln.

On April 15 you published a diatribe by Mordechai Brener. I say diatribe because it was neither an opinion nor a discussion. It was an attack on any Jew who does not share his view of life. If Israel is a democracy, as it is supposed to be, what about the views of others living here, who are not Orthodox? Many of us citizens hold other views of Judaism and by most accounts, polls and statistics, the Orthodox are a minority. I was taught the definition of a democracy was a place where the majority rules and minority rights are respected.
Brener talks about people wearing immodest dress in Mea She’arim and Bnei Brak. But who defines what constitutes modest dress? Does “immodest dress” give someone permission to spit on, insult or physically assault women, or even children, who do not meet his standard?
I think we, the people he is attacking, are more than tolerant in allowing this small minority to deny us access to transportation, restaurants, stores and entertainment. Why not trust the rest of us to do what we believe honors our dead and the things that are important to us − and that we learn through education, not coercion?
Brener talks about “desecrating the Sabbath” with disdain and contempt. Several years ago, my son was a member of the Jerusalem police. One night, he and his partner were sent to a religious section of the city because of a fire reported in a residential building. He and his partner arrived before fire trucks or other police units. They were ordered not to enter the building or make rescue attempts. Still, they felt it was their duty to enter the building and warn the inhabitants about the fire. They pounded on doors and pulled people out. When they emerged from the building, they were greeted not by cheers from tenants of nearby buildings, but by a barrage of bottles, garbage and cries from the rooftops that they had “desecrated the Sabbath.”
On returning to their station, they were officially reprimanded for disobeying orders, but were comforted by the thought of children, dirty from the smoke, but alive and well. And this is desecration?

Awe at the ingathering of long-exiled exiles
In response to “Home, but not free” ‏(Opinion, Alon Idan, April 15‏).
As one who stood alone in silence gazing out my window the other night as Israel ground to a halt for a moment’s reflection, I feel compelled to respond to Alon Idan’s scathing opinion piece “Home, but not free,” and his 1984-ish comment that people who do so, do so out of fear.
My reaction to his views was intensified by the fact that moments before reading his piece, I had parted from an older friend, a widow who does what she can to commemorate these holidays − out of awe, not fear. Born in Nazi Germany and raised in a large Scandinavian country, she migrated with her family to South Africa during apartheid. The Scandinavian country had denied her citizenship, and South Africa always remained for her an alien place. “I never felt at home anywhere but here,” she told me.
Unlike your unnamed citizens standing alone in their dwellings, she was not filled with fear of the state, but awe, appreciation and love. I suggest that others who did so were not unlike her. It’s not a knee-jerk reaction, a “religious signifier,” but a deeply felt connection.
Interestingly enough, these holidays fall on the third week after Passover, closely allied with the attribute of tiferet, compassion − one which seems to be sorely lacking in Idan’s rather robotic critique.
Perhaps you, Mr. Idan, are younger than the state, born here of parents who are also younger than the state? It’s not fear of the state, but love and awe at the ingathering of our long-exiled exiles that underline these collective moments of silence and reflection. Perhaps if Idan could find a place of greater compassion within himself, he could more easily comprehend the other’s love for the Land of Israel.

<title>New routes to racism</title>
<date>Tue Mar 05 04:20:00 IST 2013</date>

	At the beginning of the week, separate bus lines were launched for Palestinians in the territories who travel into Israel. The Transportation Ministry claims the lines are meant to ease travel conditions for the Palestinians, but they’re actually another manifestation of a regime based on discrimination and segregation.
	Although by law a Palestinian with a permit to enter Israel cannot be prevented from traveling on regular buses, the police is preparing to enforce the separation. Consequently, a Palestinian who reaches a checkpoint on a regular Israeli bus will be asked to get off and wait for the special bus.
	Palestinians traveling from Tel Aviv to Samaria were apparently already being taken off buses last Thursday. According to witnesses, an entire busload of people were ordered off a bus near the Shaar Shomron interchange, and their identity cards were checked. All of the passengers turned out to be Palestinians, and they were ordered to leave the terminal and walk to the Azoun-Othma checkpoint, 2.5 kilometers away. According to the police, they were merely implementing Transportation Ministry instructions.
	Around four years ago the High Court of Justice disallowed the ban on Palestinians traveling on Route 443, arguing that the military occupier cannot build roads in an occupied area that do not serve the local population. Then Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch, however, got upset by the comparison the petitioners had made between separate roads and the apartheid regime in South Africa. But the decision to separate Palestinians and Jews on the buses is another component of an apartheid approach, and demonstrates that those petitioners’ arguments were not unfounded.
	It’s clear that the bus segregation is part of a more principled separation between the populations that is expressed in almost every area: In the allocation of areas for residential construction, in the different legal systems, in the unequitable distribution of resources and in discriminatory travel regulations.
	Occupied territory is meant to be managed by the occupying state as a temporary trust for the benefit of the local population. There are clear rules aimed at preventing the evolution of a colonial or apartheid regime. The way the State of Israel is managing the territories is a far cry from the way occupied lands are meant to be managed.
	Rather than express “concern” for the Palestinians by excluding them from Jewish bus lines, it would behoove the prime minister to immediately put a stop to this racist segregation.

<title>Weaken the right </title>
<date>Fri Jan 18 03:45:00 IST 2013</date>

	Benjamin Netanyahu's outgoing government caused serious damage to Israel over its four-year term. Its foreign policy focused on expanding the settlements, avoiding negotiations with the Palestinians and reviving the idea of annexing the occupied territories. The result was intense international isolation, a rift in the relationship with the United States and a terrifying vision of Israel's future. Its domestic policies were characterized by pure nationalism, harassment of the Arab minority, politicization and militarism in the education system, and bringing initiatives to destroy the Supreme Court and weaken the free press.
	Isolationism, nationalism and threats to democracy and civil rights are the banners of the right-wing parties, which are running in the elections with their most radical lists of candidates ever. The Likud has united with Avigdor Lieberman and thrown out such liberals from its ranks as Dan Meridor and Benny Begin to make room for Moshe Feiglin. Naftali Bennett was chosen to head Habayit Hayehudi, which preached the annexation of Area C in the West Bank and cleansing the media of left-wing journalists.
	The dangerous direction in which the right has turned requires all supporters of democracy and openness to the world to go to the polls and vote for parties that will stand in opposition to Netanyahu and his "natural partners." The choice is not simple. The camp that opposes the right has failed to join ranks and pick a candidate for prime minister. Among center and left-wing voters there are voices of despair saying "there is no one to vote for," but they must not be heeded. There is no more important commandment than to vote on election day in 2013.
	Meretz has presented the most suitable platform, with uncompromising support for ending the occupation, dividing the Land of Israel into two nations, separating religion from state and strengthening civil rights, including those of the Arab minority. Moreover, Meretz will not join a Netanyahu government, and the polls forecast the party doubling its strength. The Labor Party has strengthened in the polls and has a refreshing list of candidates, but Shelly Yacimovich's leadership does not present an alternative to the Likud. Her evasion of issues and support of the settlers, Haredim and the wasteful defense budget is worrisome. Her test will be in keeping her promise not to join a right-wing government.
	Those who don't want to vote for opposition parties can choose between Tzipi Livni's Hatnuah, Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid and Kadima, headed by Shaul Mofaz, in the hope they will join with Netanyahu and moderate the influence of the extreme right and Haredim. Out of all of them, Livni has stood out in her exhortations for an agreement with the Palestinians and rebuilding the relationship with the United States. Israeli democracy will be better off if Arab voters vote in high numbers and strengthen Hadash, Balad and the United Arab List-Ta'al against right-wing persecution. As opposed to the two "sectoral" Arab parties, Hadash is also competing with Meretz for left-wing Jewish voters. Its platform is much more radical, but its importance is in strengthening the struggle of Jews and Arabs for common goals.
	The undecided voter has quite a lot of alternatives, but the principle that must guide his or her vote is clear: Weakening the right-wing parties and the Haredim in order to halt Israel's slide into political isolation, fascism and apartheid.

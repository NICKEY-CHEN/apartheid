<title>Ashrawi linked NGO apologizes for blood libel claim</title>
<date>11/4/2013</date>
<content>
NEW YORK – Writers for MIFTAH – a nonprofit founded in 1998 by Hanan Ashrawi, a 
vocal advocate for the Palestinian cause who is well regarded by Western 
officials – resurfaced a centuries-old smear over the Passover holiday on their 
Arabic website that accuses Jews of using Christian blood in the preparation of 
Passover matza.Invocation of the blood libel shocked Jewish groups after 
it was picked up in English by a blog called the Elder of Ziyon.




The 
collective pressure from these groups over several days was apparently enough to 
force a retraction from MIFTAH – only after the nonprofit initially refused to 
apologize.But the true shock has come from MIFTAH’s benefactors, who 
have struggled to distance their financial support over several years from the 
organization’s more extremist activities.The governments of Italy, 
Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, and Norway, among other EU members, have provided 
funding for MIFTAH at least through 2011, according to NGO Monitor, which tracks 
the financing of major nongovernmental organizations.And the National 
Endowment for Democracy (NED), which is funded through an act of US Congress, 
has provided MIFTAH with nearly $180,000 between 2007 and 2012.“The 
whole funding process is very cloudy – it’s not very transparent at all,” said 
Gerald Steinberg, president of NGO Monitor. “The NED didn’t do their due 
diligence.Hanan Ashrawi was able to sell [MIFTAH’s] activities as 
pro-peace and pro-civil society, and they didn’t look to see what kind of 
organization they’re running. It was probably based more than anything on 
personal connections, which is obviously a problem.”Made aware of these 
concerns, the NED told The Jerusalem Post that its financial support for MIFTAH 
was directed toward its young leaders program, and was never directed toward its 
website operations.NED’s spokesman noted that additional funding for 
MIFTAH was not granted this year by the NED board of directors.But when 
asked how the NED tracked its funding as earmarked for youth programs, as 
opposed to its website operations, they had no additional 
comment.“Funders need to be vigilant about the groups they fund, and 
require accountability,” said Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti- 
Defamation League, calling the entire episode “outrageous.”While 
Steinberg believes that Ashrawi’s clout brings in easy money, he says that 
unfortunately that’s how the nonprofit world often works, and that MIFTAH is 
hardly exceptional.Yet MIFTAH, an organization with the explicit mission 
of furthering the narrative of the Palestinian cause, has succeeded in gaining 
repeated partnerships with UNESCO, which could not be reached for comment for 
this story.“European organizations are in the news every day discussing 
settlements, and they refuse to repudiate things like this,” said Marvin Hier, 
founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.“UNESCO should never have 
accepted the false Palestinian narrative.”In the past, MIFTAH has 
published on its website accusations of Israeli genocide, mass murder, and 
apartheid against the Palestinians.“MIFTAH addresses the grievances 
caused by the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and all of the illegal 
practices that come with it,” Joharah Baker, a writer for MIFTAH, said to the 
Post in an email.“Our goal is a two-state solution that provides justice 
to the Palestinians; anti- Semitism does not fit into our philosophy or 
rhetoric, and never will.”

<title>Bar Refaeli to BDS supporter Roger Waters: Don't use my picture</title>
<date>21/8/2013</date>
<content>
Supermodel Bar Refaeli on Wednesday called for British rocker and vocal Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist Roger Waters to remove a photograph of her used during the former Pink Floyd front man's performances. Refaeli demanded Waters not use her image if he is promoting a cultural boycott on her home country .




Her reprisal came after the rock legend published an open letter earlier in the week calling on his colleagues to join such a boycott.  The blonde beauty posted in Hebrew on her Twitter (@BarRefaeli): “Roger Waters, you should remove my picture from the video art at your concerts. If you’re boycotting - then go all the way.”“I write to you now, my brothers and sisters in the family of Rock and Roll, to ask you to join with me, and thousands of other artists around the world, to declare a cultural boycott on Israel,” Waters wrote in the letter condemning Israel for what he claimed was apartheid and ethnic cleansing.

<title>Billionaire Marc Rich laid to rest in quiet Israel ceremony</title>
<date>27/6/2013</date>
<content>
KIBBUTZ EINAT, Israel - Billionaire Marc Rich, the pioneering oil trader who was also a fugitive from US justice for tax evasion, racketeering and busting sanctions with Iran, was laid to rest in a quiet funeral outside Tel Aviv on Thursday.About 100 people, mostly family and old business associates, attended the Jewish religious funeral in the pastoral grounds of Kibbutz Einat, where those who spoke described Rich as loving, kind and generous and not as his public image might suggest.




He was buried next to his daughter, Gabrielle, who died of leukemia in 1996 at the age of 27.The rabbi of Jerusalem's Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinovitch, led a prayer at the ceremony.Avner Azulay, managing director of the Marc Rich Foundation, said few people really knew Rich. "You did in this world more good than people know," he eulogized.Belgian-born Rich fled the Holocaust with his parents for America to become the most successful and controversial trader of his time and a fugitive from US justice. He died on Wednesday in Switzerland aged 78 of a stroke.His trading group Marc Rich and Co AG in Switzerland eventually became the global commodities powerhouse Glencore Xstrata.Absent from the funeral were the elite of Israel's business world and leading politicians such as former prime ministers Ehud Barak and Shimon Peres, who lobbied then US president Bill Clinton on Rich's behalf for his pardon.A son of Peres did attend the funeral, as did Glencore Xstrata chief executive Ivan Glasenberg and the daughter of former partner Pincus "Pinky" Green.In interviews with journalist Daniel Ammann for his biography, The King of Oil, the normally secretive Rich admitted to assisting the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad.Interviewed in the book, Rich was asked about that assistance. He replied: "First of all, I'm Jewish. Second, Israel is a country I'm involved with. I'm a citizen. It's a natural thing for me to help Israel."Ammann told Reuters he believed the low point of Rich's life was when his daughter Gabrielle died. According to Azulay, he would visit her grave every time he came to Israel and sit in silence with tears in his eyes.But in his business dealings, Ammann believed Rich had few regrets."He had no remorse at all," Ammann said. "I asked him openly if he had any remorse about trading with apartheid South Africa, but he always said he was not a politician but a trader."Rich fled to Switzerland in 1983 to escape charges that included exploiting the US embargo against Iran, while it was holding US hostages, to make huge profits on illicit Iranian oil sales. He always insisted he did nothing illegal."So many were misinformed and misguided by the media image constantly distorting and demonizing, including in his last days," Azulay said.He remained under threat of a life sentence in a US jail until Clinton pardoned him during the last chaotic hours of his presidency, a move that provoked moral outrage and bewilderment among some politicians. He never returned to the United States.Rich's ex-wife, Denise, had donated funds to Clinton's presidential library.The former president later said the donation was not a factor in his decision and he had acted partly in response to a request from Israel. He regretted granting the pardon, calling it "terrible politics."
"May you rest in peace now with Gabrielle and with (your parents) Paula and David," Denise said. "Thank you so much for all your generosity and for all the lives you touched and you helped because of your philanthropy."

<title>Israeli Arabs to strike against Prawer-Begin plan</title>
<date>15/7/2013</date>
<content>
The Follow-up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel, which includes all Arab 
political parties and NGOs working with the sector, announced a general strike 
in Arab communities for Monday.Thabet Abu Rass of Adalah, an Arab legal 
rights group, told The Jerusalem Post that the strike had been called to protest 
the Prawer-Begin plan, which seeks to regulate Arab settlement in the Negev by 
legalizing 63 percent of claimed land. The bill has already passed its first 
reading in the Knesset.




There will be a demonstration at 10:00 a.m. 
outside the Beersheba offices of the committee for regulating the Beduin 
villages. Protesters will march there from Ben-Gurion University, stated Haia 
Noach, CEO of the Negev Coexistence Forum, which supports the Beduin, in a 
statement to the Post.Abu Rass, who heads Adalah’s Negev branch, told 
the Post that “the government of Israel has declared a war on the Beduin and 
Arab community.” The land issue “has the potential of inflaming Arab-Jewish 
relations in Israel,” he said.“We are calling on the government to 
freeze the plan for six months and start an open dialogue with the Beduin,” he 
added, charging that the whole point of the Prawer-Begin plan was to confiscate 
Beduin land for Jewish use.He described the government’s policy as that 
of “apartheid,” stating that building Jewish towns on the ruins of Arab villages 
was “racism and against Jewish values.”Asked about illegal Beduin 
settlement, Abu Rass acknowledged that there were “some Beduin people breaking 
the law,” adding that “the police can take care of them, but you can’t blame the 
entire community.”Right-wing parties and the NGO Regavim, which has been 
active in the matter, “don’t want the Beduin to get anything,” he 
claimed.Ari Briggs, international relations director of Regavim, an NGO 
that seeks to ensure responsible, legal and accountable use of Israel’s national 
land, told the Post that it was time to bring the rule of law to the Negev. The 
strike was just a way for the Beduin and their supporters to “ratchet up 
internal pressure on Israel,” he said.“At the same time they are 
increasing their efforts overseas to apply external pressure on Israel,” Briggs 
continued.“Their goal – bring Israel to its knees and thus get 100% of 
their illegitimate demands,” he said.The Beduin and their supporters, he 
went on, “are trying to use the ‘indigenous’ argument, even though they are not 
indigenous, in order to put them above the law. Each person should be judged by the 
law equally.”Briggs added that 2,000 illegal structures were being built 
each year in the Negev.
He said these figures were from the Interior 
Ministry and had been backed up by Regavim’s research.

<title>Palestinian NGO accuses Israel of 'water apartheid'</title>
<date>11/4/2013</date>
<content>
A report by a Palestinian NGO has accused Israel of practicing "water apartheid" and depriving Palestinians of their “rightful water supply.” Israel's Water Authority has dismissed the report as a “political weapon.”Titled “Water For One People Only: Discriminatory Access and 
‘Water-Apartheid’ in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,” the report is a 
product of the Ramallah-based non-governmental organization Al-Haq.




The 
document slams Israel for providing “discriminatory access” to water and 
enacting “water apartheid” policies that result in the 500,000 Israelis in the 
West Bank and east Jerusalem receiving six times the amount of water that the 
2.6 million Palestinians in the same area do.Although Israel has 
integrated the Palestinian water system with the Israeli one, the government 
denies the Palestinians control over their resource – forcing them to rely 
primarily on water from Mekorot, Israel’s national water company, the report 
argues.Before the 1995 Oslo II Accords, the Palestinians expected that 
such an agreement would grant them more undisputed access to their water 
resources, yet the pact “merely formalized a discriminatory management regime 
that was largely already in place,” according to the Al- Haq document. The 
authors blast Israel for maintaining exclusive control over the Mountain Aquifer 
and accuse Mekorot of continually reducing Palestinian water supplies to satisfy 
settlement water needs during the summer months.Describing Israel’s role 
as that of an “occupying power,” the authors go on to criticize the country for 
violating international humanitarian law, under which is it not supposed to 
receive sovereign rights over the occupied territory or its natural 
resources.“Israel has extensively and unlawfully appropriated 
Palestinian water resources in the Occupied Palestinian Territories for the sole 
benefit of those residing in Israel and Israeli colonies, while maintaining a 
practice of extensive destruction of Palestinian water infrastructure,” the 
report says.Due to the country’s so called exploitation and appropriation 
of Palestinian natural resources, the authors of the report deem Israel a 
colonial nation. Whereas Jewish Israelis have the privilege of “an uninterrupted 
and abundant supply of water,” Palestinians “are denied their basic right to 
water and full development as a group,” the authors write.The authors 
recommend that Israel and third-party states take immediate steps to end the 
situation and devise structural changes to the management system for shared 
water resources. In the short and intermediate term, such changes would entail 
removing the physical obstacles the Palestinians face to accessing water 
resources, as well as ceasing Israeli extraction of water from the Palestinian 
portion of the trans-boundary resource, the document says. In the long-term, 
however, the authors believe that the only solution to a proper division of 
water resources will be the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
state.In response to the document, the Israeli Water Authority stressed 
that “it was not for nothing” that both sides signed the Oslo agreement, which 
also received the approval of the United States, Russia, the European Union, 
Norway, Egypt and Jordan.“It is surprising that the Palestinian 
Authority uses the subject of water as a ‘political weapon’ while the water 
agreement granted the Palestinians quantities of water and well-being that they 
never had before,” the Water Authority said. “If only the Palestinians were 
focused on implementing the agreement as written – the situation would be even 
better than it is today.”Aiming to disprove many of the assertions made 
through the report, the Water Authority provided a detailed list of water 
consumption data for both West Bank Jews and Palestinians.The Water 
Authority stressed that Israel uses less water from the Mountain Aquifer than in 
1967, while the Palestinians are drawing much more from the aquifer compared to 
before 1967. Meanwhile, settlers use less water than Israel sends into the West 
Bank, the authority said.Palestinians consume about 190 million cubic 
meters of water per year, compared to 60 million cubic meters in 1967 and 118 
million cubic meters in 1995 – the year the accords were signed, according to 
Water Authority data. Whereas only 10 percent of Palestinians in the West Bank 
were connected to an organized water system before 1967, 95% are today, making 
their conditions much better than those in most capital cities of Arab countries 
neighboring Israel, the authority said.Countering the report’s claims 
that Israel has sovereign power over decisions regarding water distribution, the 
Water Authority noted that the Joint Water Committee includes representatives 
from both Israel and the PA, with the sides enjoying equal status. The Joint 
Water Committee has approved hundreds of projects, most of which are Palestinian 
and of which 100 are water wells, the authority added.To help the 
Palestinians develop their water system, Israel provides Palestinian water 
professionals with training and courses on sanitation, waste-water treatment, 
water reuse and desalination, the Water Authority response 
stressed.Opposing the claims that Israel has been violating the Oslo 
Accords, the Water Authority said that the Palestinians are the ones infringing 
the agreement. Although the PA is required to purify its sewage, it does not and 
instead sends about 17 million cubic meters of sewage into Israel annually, the 
authority noted. This occurs despite international offers worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars to upgrade the Palestinian water sector, the response 
continued. In addition, the PA loses more than 33% of its water due to faulty 
water pipes, and by reducing losses and treating sewage, could increase its 
usable water supply by 50 million cubic meters annually, the Water Authority 
said.
“The report seeks to absolve the Palestinian Authority of its 
commitments according to the agreement that was signed by them, and makes 
demands of the State of Israel far beyond what was agreed upon in the water 
accord,” the Water Authority said.

<title>Schools mark Day for Elimination of Discrimination</title>
<date>10/3/2013</date>
<content>
In honor of International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 
March 21, the Education Ministry has decreed that schools across the country 
hold discussions on the subject of racism with students of all ages, from 
elementary to high school.The Ministry decided to mark the day earlier 
this year, due to the upcoming twoweek Passover vacation which will overlap with 
the international event.




“We see great importance in the struggle against 
racism, so we mark this day every year,” the executive director of the Education 
Ministry, Dalit Stauber, told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.“But this 
year there have been a few events in which there was racism involved, where 
innocent people, citizens, got hurt, not necessarily in the education system, 
but in general, in society,” she said.“We want to explain to the 
students why there is no place for these things,” she added.Educators 
nationwide were instructed, on Sunday, to bring the subject of the fight against 
racial discrimination into their classrooms, and to talk to their students about 
racist events that have made news headlines over the past year.The 
latest such case concerns two female teachers, an Arab and a Jew, attacked by 
haredi youth last week on their way to a condolence call in 
Jerusalem.Stauber, who publicly condemned the event and personally spoke 
to the teachers concerned, explained that the ministry found the attack 
important enough to “stop the daily agenda and say something about 
it.”“The education system took responsibility here,” she 
said.“We want to address this [racism] in the system and educate the 
kind of society that we want to live in, a society with less violence, more 
patience,” Stauber said.To facilitate this operation, the Ministry 
published relevant teaching material and studies – adapted to various grades and 
age groups – on its website for schools to use.“It goes without saying 
that we, as a people, suffered from racism and were victims of cruel 
stereotypes,” Stauber told the Post, “I think that even without this [history], 
an improved society should protect itself from such occurrences and educate 
toward tolerance, and that’s what we are doing.”“We hope that kids will 
understand that you need to respect a human being for being a human being; 
develop tolerance for the other; and be able to foster and respect the 
heterogeneity of our society, which is a society with varied cultures, varied 
religions, varied opinions,” she said.As schools nationwide addressed 
the topic, Army Radio reported on Sunday that last week, students from a school 
in the Arab town of Sakhnin allegedly threw stones at those from a visiting 
religious Jewish school in Yokne’am. No one was injured in the 
incident.According to Army Radio, the Yokne’am school headmistress 
failed to report the incident to the police and the district’s Education 
Ministry office.The Sakhnin school’s headmaster sent a letter of apology 
following the incident to the headmistress of the Yokne’am 
school.International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is 
observed annually on 21 March, which marks the day when police opened fire and 
killed 69 people at a peaceful demonstration against apartheid “pass laws,” in 
Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960.The United Nations General Assembly 
proclaimed the day in 1966, and called on the international community to 
redouble its efforts to eliminate all forms of racial 
discrimination.
Israel signed the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination the same year.
